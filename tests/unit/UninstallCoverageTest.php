/**
 * #434 Task 10 — uninstall.php removes every key the plugin stores, and the SET
 * of those keys is COMPUTED FROM SOURCE rather than remembered.
 *
 * The bug this exists for: `aura_worker_unbound` (the unbind marker, 2.13.0)
 * was not in uninstall.php's by-name list. Uninstall a disconnected site,
 * reinstall it, and activation mints a fresh token onto a site whose stale
 * marker still refuses every authenticated mutation — a site that looks new and
 * answers nothing, with nothing left on disk to explain it. It was not the only
 * miss: the ruleset, the gateway key, the connect user, both rule counters and
 * both throttle transients were never removed either, and four whole families
 * of runtime-named rows (grant nonces, expiry notices, token throttles, connect
 * transients) could not have been removed by any by-name list at all.
 *
 * The RULE, not the line. Adding six delete_option() calls fixes today and
 * guarantees a seventh miss, because the failing thing was never a particular
 * key — it was a hand-maintained enumeration sitting in the one file whose
 * entire job is to enumerate. uninstall.php now sweeps BY NAMESPACE PREFIX, and
 * this class reads the plugin's sources, works out what it stores, and fails BY
 * NAME when a key lands outside the swept namespaces.
 *
 * Three scans, because no one of them is complete on its own and each covers
 * the next one's blind spot:
 *
 *   (1) storage-function writes — every literal or class-constant key handed to
 *       update_option()/add_option()/set_transient()/…, resolved by reflection;
 *   (2) unresolved (runtime-named) writes — the same call sites whose key is
 *       computed, path-keyed and acknowledged one by one, so a NEW dynamic
 *       family cannot be added silently;
 *   (3) raw options-table writes — statements that bypass the storage API
 *       entirely and are therefore invisible to (1) and (2). The rule counters
 *       are written this way.
 *
 * WHERE THE RECURSION STOPS, and why that is defensible. Scan (1) is driven by
 * a hand-written list of WordPress storage-function names, and nothing computes
 * THAT list. It does not need to: it is WordPress's own public storage API,
 * fixed and versioned upstream, not something this plugin can extend. And the
 * one way around it — writing a row without calling any of them — is exactly
 * what scan (3) enumerates, from the table name rather than the function name.
 * So the residual hole is a key that is BOTH written through some further
 * wrapper this plugin invents AND never touches {$wpdb->options}: a row in
 * another table, which no uninstall sweep over the options table was ever going
 * to reach, and which would need its own guard. That is stated in the failure
 * messages rather than papered over.

	 *   Ruling P68 — that same rotation's two CLAIM-CONDITIONAL forms on the
	 *   same 'aura_worker_door_binding' key: an UPDATE and an INSERT, each
	 *   joined to the site claim row ('aura_worker_connect_lock'), so a stale
	 *   unbind whose claim was taken over cannot rotate the winner's binding,
	 *   and — since Ruling P73 — the ADOPTION of an `unset` record on that same
	 *   'aura_worker_door_binding' key: a compare-and-swap that states the
	 *   identity the site is already live under WITHOUT moving the generation,
	 *   so an upgraded site's own rows stay current while a replacement
	 *   connect's identity writes make the departed ones foreign at once, and —
	 *   since Ruling P91 — the EPOCH WITNESS re-stamp on that same key, which a
	 *   grant-gated `/door/rotate` makes so a legitimate cursor rotation is not
	 *   mistaken for a half-done rebind. (Ruling P90 added no statement: it
	 *   JOINED the ack's existing two — the floor raise on
	 *   'aura_worker_door_log_acked' and the row purge on
	 *   'aura_worker_door_log_<seq>' — to 'aura_worker_door_epoch', so neither
	 *   can cross a rotation.)
	 *   All names fall under the swept 'aura_worker_' prefix. And — since
	 *   2.16.2, Ruling A65 — the site-issued observation witness's own atomic
	 *   increment (bump_door_version()'s INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE on
	 *   'aura_worker_door_observation'), the same upsert shape bump_refused()
	 *   above already uses. Also under the swept 'aura_worker_' prefix. And —
	 *   since Ruling S82, Codex round-33 P2 on #88 — restamp_observation_forward()'s
	 *   OWN INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE on that SAME
	 *   'aura_worker_door_observation' key: a clock-and-witness-floored
	 *   restamp Aura's own `door_observation_seen` (see
	 *   Aura_Worker_Elementor_Door::maybe_restamp_observation_forward()'s
	 *   own docblock) forces past a value this site's copy has fallen
	 *   behind after a whole-DB restore. Same key as bump_door_version()'s
	 *   own write above, already under the swept 'aura_worker_' prefix. And —
	 *   since Ruling S30, Codex round-13 P1 on #88, superseded by Ruling S32,
	 *   Codex round-14 P1 on #88 — versioned()'s DURABLE commit-witness
	 *   write, a PLAIN INSERT (no ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE — a real second
	 *   INSERT of the same name would collide) on
	 *   'aura_worker_door_tx_<nonce>' inside every mutating transaction,
	 *   before the version bump: a plain option row survives a reconnect
	 *   that a MySQL session variable does not, so it stands in for the
	 *   session nonce (Ruling S16) when that nonce cannot be read back
	 *   after COMMIT. Named BY the transaction's own nonce (S30's row was
	 *   ONE shared key every unit overwrote, so a second unit's commit
	 *   could land on it between this unit's write and its own read-back)
	 *   so two concurrent units' witness rows can never collide. The unit
	 *   deletes its own row once the check is settled, and a bounded
	 *   janitor DELETE (LIKE 'aura_worker_door_tx_%' AND older than
	 *   LAST_TX_MAX_AGE_S, at most LAST_TX_JANITOR_LIMIT rows) sweeps up
	 *   whatever a died process left behind — the DELETEs are not counted
	 *   here (the ledger only tracks INSERT/UPDATE call sites), but both
	 *   fall under the swept 'aura_worker_' prefix same as the INSERT.
	 * - includes/class-elementor-door-governor.php (3, 2.16.0) — the door's
	 *   rolling 30-day counters, in the rule counters' shape:
	 *   'aura_worker_door_c_<name>_h<hour>', an atomic
	 *   INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE no scan of function calls could see.
	 *   Under the swept 'aura_worker_' prefix. And — since Ruling S26,
	 *   Codex round-11 P1 on #88 — sync_computed_state()'s persist of the
	 *   computed `{ active, seam, door }` tuple on 'aura_worker_door_computed':
	 *   a real conditional INSERT (`WHERE NOT EXISTS`, insert_unique_write()'s
	 *   own shape) for the first-ever mint, and a fenced compare-and-swap
	 *   UPDATE on the exact bytes last read, so a request racing a newer
	 *   transition can never overwrite it blind. Also under the swept
	 *   'aura_worker_' prefix.
