Connect your WordPress site to the Aura dashboard for remote monitoring, plugin & theme updates, and maintenance — all from one place.

== Description ==

**SiteAgent** is the bridge between your WordPress sites and the [Aura infrastructure dashboard](https://my-aura.app) — a unified control center for teams managing multiple WordPress sites alongside servers, CDN, and DNS.

Install this plugin on any WordPress site to unlock remote management capabilities directly from Aura — no SSH, no wp-admin juggling, no manual logins.

= What You Can Do =

* **Monitor site health** — See WordPress version, PHP version, installed plugins & themes, database info, and disk usage in real time.
* **Update plugins, themes & core remotely** — Push updates to any connected site from the Aura dashboard, no wp-admin login.
* **Safe batch updates with auto-rollback** — Run chunked updates with health checks; if an update breaks the site, the plugin restores the previous version automatically.
* **Per-plugin rollback** — Every update is zip-snapshotted first; restore any plugin to its last good state on demand.
* **Bulk translation & database upgrades** — Update all language packs and run WordPress database migrations remotely.
* **One-click connect (magic link)** — Connect a site to Aura straight from wp-admin — no manual token copy/paste.
* **AI-agent ready (21 MCP tools)** — Exposes machine-readable, JSON-schema tools for AI-driven management, including SEO/accessibility/performance/broken-link auditors, on-site SEO-meta read/write (Rank Math, Yoast, SEOPress), and Gutenberg block read/edit. Read tools run on demand; mutating tools are approval-gated through Aura, and every call is audited.
* **Zero frontend impact** — The plugin only registers REST API endpoints. No scripts, no styles, no database queries on visitor-facing page loads.

= How It Works =

After activation, click **Connect to Aura** on the **Settings → SiteAgent** page for a one-click magic-link connection, or copy the Site Token shown once and paste it into your Aura dashboard manually. From that point, Aura communicates with your site over a signed, authenticated REST API to pull health data and push updates.

= Security =

Defence-in-depth protects every request:

1. **WordPress Application Password** — Standard WordPress auth with capability checks (`manage_options` / `update_*`). Only authorized administrators can trigger actions.
2. **Hashed Site Token** — A per-site token sent via the `X-Aura-Token` header. Only a SHA-256 **hash** is stored (never the raw token), compared timing-safely. Tokens from older versions migrate to a hash automatically.
3. **Brute-force throttling** — Repeated bad-token attempts from an IP are blocked.
4. **Signed magic-link connect** — The onboarding callback is HMAC-signed with a one-time secret and timestamp, so the token exchange can't be hijacked or replayed.
5. **IP / Domain allowlist** (optional) — Restrict API access to your Aura instance, with Cloudflare and reverse-proxy header support.

You can rotate the token anytime from **Settings → SiteAgent → Regenerate Token**.

= REST API Endpoints =

Core endpoints under `/wp-json/aura/v1/`:

* `GET /status` — Full site health report
* `GET /updates` — Check available updates (core, plugins, themes, translations)
* `POST /update/core` / `/update/plugin` / `/update/theme` / `/update/translations` — Apply updates
* `POST /update/database` — Run WordPress database upgrades
* `POST /connect` — Magic-link token exchange (public, HMAC-signed, 10-minute expiry)

Version 2 endpoints under `/wp-json/aura/v2/`:

* `GET /health` — HTTP, PHP fatal, white-screen and DB connectivity checks
* `POST /update/batch` — Chunked batch updates with auto-rollback on health failure
* `POST /rollback/{plugin}` — Restore a plugin from its most recent backup

MCP tools under `/wp-json/aura/mcp/`:

* `POST /tools/list` / `POST /tools/execute` — Enumerate and run AI-agent tools
* `GET /context` — Full site context for AI decision-making

= AI Agent Tools (MCP) =

SiteAgent ships **21 built-in tools** for AI agents. Read tools return information and run on demand; write tools change the site and are queued for human approval through Aura — an agent can never silently mutate a production site.

Read tools:

* `get_site_context` — WordPress/PHP/theme/plugin/disk/performance snapshot with detected issues
* `get_database_info` — Database size, largest tables, autoloaded-options weight, expired transients
* `scan_security` — Scored security posture (file-edit lockdown, debug exposure, SSL, default admin/prefix, open registration, PHP version)
* `scan_seo` — SEO posture (search-engine visibility, permalinks, XML sitemap, site title) plus a sampled content audit (thin content, missing excerpts/featured images)
* `scan_a11y` — Accessibility audit over sampled content (images missing alt text, non-descriptive link text, heading structure, document language)
* `perf_check` — Performance posture (persistent object cache, OPcache, page-cache plugin, PHP version, autoload weight, active plugin count, memory limit)
* `scan_broken_links` — Link triage over a content sample with no outbound HTTP (empty/anchor-only links, dev/staging hosts, unresolved internal links)
* `list_users` — Users with roles and post counts, administrators flagged (never returns secrets)
* `check_health` — Live health gate: HTTP status, PHP fatals, white-screen, database connectivity
* `scan_error_log` — Tails and severity-groups the error log, surfacing recent fatals
* `check_vulnerabilities` — Plugins/themes checked against the WordPress.org vulnerability database
* `get_seo_meta` — Read a post/page's SEO title, description, and focus keyword from the active SEO plugin (Rank Math, Yoast, or SEOPress)
* `list_page_blocks` — Read a page's Gutenberg block structure (block names, attributes, nesting)

Write tools (approval-gated):

* `update_plugin_safely` — Backup, update, health-check, auto-rollback on failure
* `clear_caches` — Flush object/opcode caches and detected page-cache plugins
* `cleanup_transients` — Remove expired transients to reduce autoload bloat
* `cleanup_orphaned_assets` — Find and remove unused media (dry-run by default)
* `backup_plugins` — Zip-snapshot one or all active plugins as a rollback safety net
* `set_seo_meta` — Write a post/page's SEO title / description / focus keyword on the active SEO plugin (Rank Math, Yoast, or SEOPress) — on-site, so it works even when a WAF blocks the plugin's own REST endpoint
* `update_page_block` — Update a Gutenberg block's content or attributes (snapshot-first, reversible)
* `create_page_from_blocks` — Create a new page from a Gutenberg block spec (draft-first)

Tools are classified by verb so the Aura Fleet gateway applies the right risk and approval policy automatically.

= About Aura =

Aura is a full-stack operations dashboard by [Digitizer](https://digitizer.studio) that brings servers, applications, DNS zones, and CDN pull zones from Cloudways, Hostinger VPS, Cloudflare, and Bunny.net into a single unified interface.

SiteAgent extends that reach into every WordPress installation — so you can manage your entire infrastructure, including WordPress sites, from one place.

= Free to Use =

The plugin is completely free and open source (GPLv2+). You need a free or paid Aura account to connect your sites. [Sign up at my-aura.app](https://my-aura.app).

2. Search for **SiteAgent**.
3. Click **Install Now**, then **Activate**.
4. Navigate to **Settings → SiteAgent**.
5. Click **Connect to Aura** for one-click magic-link onboarding — or copy the Site Token (shown once) and paste it into your Aura dashboard manually.

= Via WP-CLI =

`wp plugin install digitizer-site-worker --activate`

= Manual Upload =

1. Download the plugin ZIP from WordPress.org.
2. Go to **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.
3. Upload the ZIP and click **Install Now**, then **Activate**.
4. Navigate to **Settings → SiteAgent** to connect or get your Site Token.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an Aura account? =

Yes, you need an Aura account to connect your WordPress sites. Aura offers a free tier that includes up to 3 WordPress sites. [Sign up at my-aura.app](https://my-aura.app).

= Is this plugin safe to use? =

Yes. The plugin uses defence-in-depth: WordPress Application Passwords (the same standard mechanism used by the block editor), a per-site token stored only as a SHA-256 hash and verified timing-safely, per-IP brute-force throttling, an HMAC-signed onboarding handshake, and an optional IP/domain allowlist. No data is transmitted unless a request is made by your Aura instance.

= How do I enable the approval gate for write actions? =

SiteAgent can require a per-action, cryptographically signed approval before it runs a state-changing **MCP tool** (cleanups, cache flushes, SEO writes, safe plugin updates run through the tool interface). Once enabled, each such write must carry a single-use signature that only the Aura dashboard can mint, after a human approves the action — so a leaked Site Token cannot run those tools on its own.

This gate turns on automatically once the site holds Aura's approval key, which is provisioned securely during connection. **If you installed or updated the plugin but have not reconnected the site since, the gate is dormant** and the site runs in the standard token-only mode. To activate it, simply **reconnect the site from your Aura dashboard** — no reinstall is needed.

Note: the approval gate currently covers the MCP tool path. Core, plugin, and theme updates performed over the plugin's direct REST update endpoints are still authorized by the Site Token alone (the standard site-management model), so treat the Site Token as a sensitive credential regardless. Grant coverage for those update endpoints is on the roadmap.

= Does it slow down my site? =

No. The plugin registers only REST API endpoints. It does not load any code, scripts, or database queries on frontend page loads. Your visitors experience zero impact.

= What WordPress versions are supported? =

WordPress 6.2 or higher is required. This is needed for full Application Password support. The plugin has been tested up to WordPress 7.0.

= What PHP versions are supported? =

PHP 7.4 or higher. PHP 8.0+ is recommended.

= Can I restrict which IP addresses can access the API? =

Yes. The plugin supports an optional IP whitelist. If configured, only requests from the specified IP addresses will be accepted. Cloudflare and reverse proxy headers (`CF-Connecting-IP`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`) are fully supported for IP detection.

= Does this work with WordPress multisite? =

The plugin is designed for single WordPress installations. Multisite support is not currently available but is on the roadmap.

= Where is the Site Token stored? =

Only a SHA-256 **hash** of the Site Token is stored, in the WordPress option `aura_worker_site_token` — the raw token is never persisted. It is generated on first activation and shown once so you can copy it; the Aura dashboard keeps the only raw copy. Tokens created by older versions are upgraded to a hash automatically on first use.

= Can I regenerate the Site Token? =

Yes. Use **Regenerate Token** on the **Settings → SiteAgent** page. The new token is shown once. Regenerating invalidates the old token and disconnects the site from Aura until you reconnect with the new one.

= How do I disconnect a site from Aura? =

Simply deactivate or delete the plugin, or remove the site from your Aura dashboard. If you deactivate the plugin, the REST API endpoints are unregistered and Aura can no longer communicate with the site.

= Does Aura store my wp-admin credentials? =

No. Aura uses WordPress Application Passwords, not your main admin password. Application Passwords are scoped specifically for REST API access and can be revoked at any time from **Users → Your Profile** in wp-admin.

= Is the plugin open source? =

Yes. SiteAgent is open source under the GPLv2 or later license. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Digitizers/SiteAgent).

== Changelog ==

= 2.7.0 =
* Approval gate now covers the direct REST write endpoints, not just MCP tools.
  When a site has provisioned Aura's approval key, plugin/theme/core/translation
  updates, batch updates, database migrations, rollbacks, and self-update each
  require a fresh single-use signed grant bound to the exact action and
  parameters — so a leaked Site Token can no longer trigger a code update on its
  own. Sites without the key keep working as before (token-only) until they
  reconnect.
* Self-update source allowlist: SiteAgent will only install a self-update zip
  from the official GitHub repository (Digitizers/SiteAgent) or GitHub's
  release-asset CDNs, over HTTPS. Overridable via the
  aura_worker_self_update_allowed_hosts filter.

= 2.6.1 =
* Tool self-declaration hardening: six mutating tools (update_plugin_safely,
  cleanup_orphaned_assets, backup_plugins, cleanup_transients, clear_caches,
  set_seo_meta) now explicitly declare themselves non-read-only and
  approval-required instead of inheriting neutral defaults, so any consumer that
  trusts a tool's own annotations gates them correctly. Grant enforcement and
  the Aura gateway's verb-based policy already treated them as writes, so live
  behaviour is unchanged.
* cleanup_orphaned_assets now advertises a preview: its dry-run (find orphans,
  delete nothing) is exposed through the preview API, so the orphaned-media
  sample and count can be inspected without approval before the destructive
  delete — which still requires approval.

= 2.6.0 =
* Signed approval grants (G-grants): every mutating (non read-only) MCP tool
  reached over the Aura gateway (X-Aura-Token) path now requires a single-use,
  Ed25519-signed grant that binds the exact tool, parameters, site, and a short
  validity window — so a stolen site token can only ever run READ tools, never a
  write or a power op. The plugin stores only the gateway's PUBLIC key, so even a
  fully compromised site can't mint its own grants; only the gateway can, and
  only for a human-approved action. The gateway public key is provisioned over
  the HMAC-signed magic-link /connect callback, and enforcement activates only
  once it is present, so existing deployments are unaffected until they
  reconnect. The WordPress Abilities / Application-Password path
  (capability-gated) is unchanged.

= 2.5.0 =
* WordPress Abilities API bridge: SiteAgent tools are now dual-registered as WP
  abilities when the core Abilities API is present, so the official MCP adapter
  and standard MCP clients can discover them (aura/mcp namespace unchanged).
* Hardening (external review): register the abilities category before the
  abilities (else a real Abilities API rejects them); default a missing input to
  {} for parameterless abilities; snapshot engine fails closed when a payload/
  metadata write fails, uses an uncollidable "absent option" sentinel, and post
  restore refuses a missing payload instead of wiping the page; Gutenberg
  update refuses inner_html on a block with nested children and surfaces the
  inner_html change in its preview; the snapshot REST file endpoint jails targets
  to wp-content and refuses wp-config.php; AURA_WORKER_VERSION synced.

= 2.4.0 =
* Gutenberg (block editor) tools: list_page_blocks (read), update_page_block
  (approval-gated, snapshot-first, reversible), create_page_from_blocks
  (draft-first). Ends the Elementor-only gap — Gutenberg is core WP.
* Snapshot engine gains a "post" kind (snapshot_post) so block edits are
  reversible.

= 2.3.0 =
* **Token-only connection** — a valid Aura Site Token now authorizes management on its own. After connecting (magic link or Regenerate Token), the plugin runs requests as the connecting administrator, so Aura no longer needs a WordPress Application Password. Existing app-password connections keep working unchanged. No new tools — the set stays at **18**.
* **Forensics hook** — fires `do_action( 'aura_worker_token_run_as', $user_id, $route )` whenever a request is authorized by token alone and run as an admin, so site owners can distinguish token-run-as from interactive admin actions in their audit log. The admin fallback is now deterministic (lowest-ID administrator).

= 2.2.4 =
* Fix: "Connect to Aura" (magic-link onboarding) now targets the Aura app host (`app.my-aura.app`) instead of the marketing domain, so one-click connect works out of the box. (Sites that set the `AURA_DASHBOARD_URL` constant are unaffected.)

= 2.2.3 =
* Fix: `set_seo_meta` on Yoast — after writing the meta, the cached Yoast indexable is now invalidated so the frontend serves the new SEO title/description immediately instead of the stale value (previously required a manual save/reindex).
* Fix: `perf_check` autoload weight — counts all WP 6.6+ autoload values (`yes`, `on`, `auto-on`, `auto`) instead of only `yes`, so the figure is no longer under-reported on newer cores.
* Fix: `scan_broken_links` — the reported counts now reflect the true number of matches; previously they were capped at the 10-item sample limit. Samples remain capped.
* Fix: `scan_seo` — missing excerpts now count toward the score (an `excerpts` finding is reported) instead of being tallied but ignored.
* Fix: `scan_a11y` document language — verified against the rendered `<html lang>` attribute of the home page rather than the configured locale, so a theme that omits `language_attributes()` is correctly flagged.

= 2.2.2 =
* Feature: On-site SEO-meta tools — two agent tools that read and write a post/page's SEO meta directly on the active SEO plugin (Rank Math, Yoast, or SEOPress):
  * `get_seo_meta` (read) — returns the SEO title, description, and focus keyword.
  * `set_seo_meta` (write, approval-gated) — sets any of title / description / focus keyword; only the fields you pass change.
* Because these run on-site via the plugin's own meta keys (not the SEO plugin's REST endpoint), they work even on sites where a firewall/WAF blocks those endpoints. Built-in tool set is now 18.

= 2.2.1 =
* Feature: Performance & broken-link auditors — two more read-only agent tools, scored/structured and no-AI-cost:
  * `perf_check` (read) — performance posture (persistent object cache, OPcache, page-cache plugin, PHP version, autoload weight, active plugin count, PHP memory limit, expired transients).
  * `scan_broken_links` (read) — link triage over a content sample with NO outbound HTTP: empty/anchor-only links, links to dev/staging hosts, and internal links that don't resolve locally.
* Built-in tool set is now 16.

= 2.2.0 =
* Feature: SEO & accessibility auditors — two new read-only agent tools, scored and no-AI-cost, governed by Aura's risk policy:
  * `scan_seo` (read) — SEO posture (search-engine visibility, permalink structure, XML sitemap, site title) plus a sampled content audit (missing excerpts/featured images, thin content).
  * `scan_a11y` (read) — accessibility audit over sampled content (images missing alt text, non-descriptive link text, missing heading structure, document language attribute).
* Both run fleet-wide through Aura's Fleet MCP Gateway to catch SEO/accessibility regressions across many sites at once.

= 2.1.0 =
* Feature: MCP ops toolset expansion — new agent tools governed by Aura's approval/risk policy:
  * `get_database_info` (read) — database size, largest tables, autoload weight, expired transient count.
  * `scan_security` (read) — scored security posture (file-edit lockdown, debug exposure, SSL, default admin/prefix, open registration, PHP version).
  * `list_users` (read) — users with roles and post counts, admins flagged; never returns secrets.
  * `check_health` (read) — live health gate (home-page HTTP, PHP fatals, white-screen, DB) for wrapping updates.
  * `scan_error_log` (read) — tails and severity-groups the PHP/WordPress error log, surfacing recent fatals.
  * `clear_caches` (write) — flush object cache, opcache, and detected page-cache plugins (W3TC, WP Super Cache, WP Rocket, LiteSpeed, Autoptimize).
  * `cleanup_transients` (write) — remove expired transients to reduce autoload bloat.
  * `backup_plugins` (write) — zip-snapshot one or all active plugins (rollback safety net) before mutating actions.

= 2.0.2 =
* Fix: Removed an arrow character from screenshot caption #1 that WordPress.org wrapped in emoji markup inside the image `alt` attribute, breaking the plugin page's HTML.

= 2.0.1 =
* Docs: readme rewritten for the 2.0 feature set (safe batch updates, rollback, magic-link, MCP), corrected security description, and added v2/MCP endpoint reference.
* Docs: fixed admin menu location — the settings page lives under **Settings → SiteAgent**.

= 2.0.0 =
* Feature: Site health checks — read recent error-log tail, surface PHP/DB/disk status in the health report.
* Feature: Plugin rollback & backup — zip-snapshot a plugin before updating and restore on demand if an update breaks the site.
* Feature: Magic-link admin access — generate a short-lived one-time login link from Aura for support sessions.
* Feature: MCP tools — expose site context, safe plugin updates, asset cleanup, and vulnerability checks to AI agents.
* Security: Site token is now stored hashed (SHA-256) instead of plaintext; existing tokens migrate automatically on first use.
* Security: Brute-force throttling on token authentication (per-IP failure limit).
* Security: Signed magic-link connect — the dashboard callback is HMAC-verified with a one-time secret and replay-protected by timestamp.
* Feature: Regenerate Token button under Settings → SiteAgent.
* Fix: Core database upgrade now reports real failures instead of always returning success (verifies db_version reached the target).
* Improvement: Tested with WordPress 7.0.
* Compliance: WordPress.org Plugin Check fixes — WP_Filesystem usage (no direct file_put_contents), gmdate(), wp_delete_file().

= 1.3.5 =
* Security: Enhanced authentication with timing-safe token comparison.
* Feature: Added optional IP whitelisting for restricted API access.
* Improvement: Support for Cloudflare and reverse proxy headers in IP detection.
* Fix: Improved compatibility with WordPress 6.7.

= 1.3.0 =
* Performance: Optimized REST API endpoints for faster health reports.
* UI: Updated admin interface under Tools for better clarity.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial release.
* REST API endpoints for site health, available updates, core/plugin/theme/translation/database updates.
* Auto-generated Site Token.
* Admin page under Tools → SiteAgent.
* Zero frontend performance impact.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 2.3.0 =
Token-only connection: the Aura Site Token alone now authorizes site management. Existing connections keep working — no action required.

= 2.2.4 =
Fixes one-click "Connect to Aura": the magic-link onboarding now targets the Aura app host (`app.my-aura.app`) instead of the marketing domain, so connect works out of the box. Sites that set the `AURA_DASHBOARD_URL` constant are unaffected.

= 2.2.3 =
Accuracy fixes for the auditor tools: `set_seo_meta` now refreshes Yoast's cache so SEO changes show immediately, `perf_check` counts all WP 6.6+ autoload values, `scan_broken_links` reports true totals, `scan_seo` scores missing excerpts, and `scan_a11y` checks the rendered page language. No changes to your site's content.

= 2.2.2 =
Adds on-site SEO-meta tools (`get_seo_meta` / `set_seo_meta`) for Rank Math, Yoast, and SEOPress — read and update a page's SEO title, description, and focus keyword across your fleet, even on sites where a WAF blocks the SEO plugin's REST endpoint. Writes are approval-gated through Aura.

= 2.2.1 =
Adds two read-only auditor tools — `perf_check` and `scan_broken_links` — for performance and link triage across your fleet. No changes to your site; `scan_broken_links` performs no outbound HTTP.

= 2.2.0 =
Adds two read-only auditor tools — `scan_seo` and `scan_a11y` — for SEO and accessibility checks across your fleet. No changes to your site; run on demand through Aura.

= 2.1.0 =
Adds five new MCP agent tools (database info, security scan, user list, cache flush, transient cleanup). Read tools run on demand; cache/transient tools are mutating and gated by Aura's approval policy.

= 2.0.2 =
Fixes the plugin page screenshot caption rendering on WordPress.org. No code changes.

= 2.0.1 =
Documentation update — corrected feature list, security description, endpoint reference, and admin menu location. No code changes.

= 2.0.0 =
Major update: plugin rollback/backup, site health checks, magic-link admin access, and MCP tools. Tested with WordPress 7.0. Recommended for all users.

= 1.3.5 =
Enhanced security with timing-safe comparison and IP whitelisting. Recommended for all users.
