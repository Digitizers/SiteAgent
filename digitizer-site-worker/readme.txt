Let AI update and maintain WordPress with Aura's guardrails: optional per-action approval, an audit trail, and auto-rollback on safe batch updates.

== Description ==

**SiteAgent** turns every WordPress site into one an AI agent can safely operate — update, maintain, audit, and fix. Once the site is connected to Aura and its approval key is provisioned, mutating actions are gated behind human approval and recorded in a full audit trail; safe batch updates and block edits are snapshotted so they can be rolled back. It's the on-site half of [Aura](https://my-aura.app), the governed control room agencies use to run whole fleets of client sites alongside their servers, CDN, and DNS.

Plugin and core updates are the riskiest thing you do on a live client site. SiteAgent makes them safer: safe batch updates run behind health checks and **roll back automatically** if the site breaks, and every plugin in that path is zip-snapshotted first. With Aura's approval key in place, an agent can't silently push a change — mutating actions wait for a human to approve them. Think of it as the undo button for AI on your clients' sites.

Install this plugin on any WordPress site to connect it to Aura — no SSH, no wp-admin juggling, no manual logins.

= What You Can Do =

* **Monitor site health** — See WordPress version, PHP version, installed plugins & themes, database info, and disk usage in real time.
* **Update plugins, themes & core remotely** — Push updates to any connected site from the Aura dashboard, no wp-admin login.
* **Safe batch updates with auto-rollback** — Run chunked updates with health checks; if an update breaks the site, the plugin restores the previous version automatically.
* **Per-plugin rollback** — Every update is zip-snapshotted first; restore any plugin to its last good state on demand.
* **Bulk translation & database upgrades** — Update all language packs and run WordPress database migrations remotely.
* **One-click connect (magic link)** — Connect a site to Aura straight from wp-admin — no manual token copy/paste.
* **AI-agent ready (27 MCP tools)** — Exposes machine-readable, JSON-schema tools for AI-driven management, including SEO/accessibility/performance/broken-link auditors, on-site SEO-meta read/write (Rank Math, Yoast, SEOPress), and Gutenberg block read/edit. Read tools run on demand; mutating tools are approval-gated through Aura, and every call is audited.
* **Zero frontend impact** — The plugin only registers REST API endpoints. No scripts, no styles, no database queries on visitor-facing page loads.

= How It Works =

After activation, click **Connect to Aura** on the **Settings → SiteAgent** page for a one-click magic-link connection, or copy the Site Token shown once and paste it into your Aura dashboard manually. From that point, Aura communicates with your site over a signed, authenticated REST API to pull health data and push updates.

= Security =

Defence-in-depth protects every request:

1. **WordPress Application Password** — Standard WordPress auth with capability checks (`manage_options` / `update_*`). Only authorized administrators can trigger actions.
2. **Hashed Site Token** — A per-site token sent via the `X-Aura-Token` header. Only a SHA-256 **hash** is stored (never the raw token), compared timing-safely. Tokens from older versions migrate to a hash automatically.
3. **Brute-force throttling** — Repeated bad-token attempts from an IP are blocked.
4. **Signed magic-link connect** — The onboarding callback is HMAC-signed with a one-time secret and timestamp, so the token exchange can't be hijacked or replayed.
5. **IP / Domain allowlist** (optional) — Restrict API access to your Aura instance, with Cloudflare and reverse-proxy header support.

You can rotate the token anytime from **Settings → SiteAgent → Regenerate Token**.

= REST API Endpoints =

Core endpoints under `/wp-json/aura/v1/`:

* `GET /status` — Full site health report
* `GET /updates` — Check available updates (core, plugins, themes, translations)
* `POST /update/core` / `/update/plugin` / `/update/theme` / `/update/translations` — Apply updates
* `POST /update/database` — Run WordPress database upgrades
* `POST /connect` — Magic-link token exchange (public, HMAC-signed, 10-minute expiry)

Version 2 endpoints under `/wp-json/aura/v2/`:

* `GET /health` — HTTP, PHP fatal, white-screen and DB connectivity checks
* `POST /update/batch` — Chunked batch updates with auto-rollback on health failure
* `POST /rollback/{plugin}` — Restore a plugin from its most recent backup
* `POST /rules` — Receive Aura's signed operator ruleset; carrying `unbind: true` it ends this site's binding instead

While a site is disconnected by Aura, every write endpoint answers
`403 aura_site_unbound` and reads keep working; the disconnect answer carries
`cleanup_complete` and `leftovers` (what the site still holds), and `GET /status`
reports `unbound` until the site is reconnected or the remaining Aura data is removed
from the settings screen.

MCP tools under `/wp-json/aura/mcp/`:

* `POST /tools/list` / `POST /tools/execute` — Enumerate and run AI-agent tools
* `GET /context` — Full site context for AI decision-making

= AI Agent Tools (MCP) =

SiteAgent ships **29 built-in tools** for AI agents. Read tools return information and run on demand; write tools change the site and are queued for human approval through Aura — an agent can never silently mutate a production site.

Read tools:

* `get_site_context` — WordPress/PHP/theme/plugin/disk/performance snapshot with detected issues
* `get_database_info` — Database size, largest tables, autoloaded-options weight, expired transients
* `scan_security` — Scored security posture (file-edit lockdown, debug exposure, SSL, default admin/prefix, open registration, PHP version)
* `scan_seo` — SEO posture (search-engine visibility, permalinks, XML sitemap, site title) plus a sampled content audit (thin content, missing excerpts/featured images)
* `scan_a11y` — Accessibility audit over sampled content (images missing alt text, non-descriptive link text, heading structure, document language)
* `perf_check` — Performance posture (persistent object cache, OPcache, page-cache plugin, PHP version, autoload weight, active plugin count, memory limit)
* `scan_broken_links` — Link triage over a content sample with no outbound HTTP (empty/anchor-only links, dev/staging hosts, unresolved internal links)
* `list_users` — Users with roles and post counts, administrators flagged (never returns secrets)
* `check_health` — Live health gate: HTTP status, PHP fatals, white-screen, database connectivity
* `scan_error_log` — Tails and severity-groups the error log, surfacing recent fatals
* `check_vulnerabilities` — Plugin update-currency check against WordPress.org (a version check, not a vulnerability/CVE feed; covers wp.org-hosted plugins)
* `check_core_checksums` — Core-file integrity against the official WordPress.org checksum manifest (modified/missing/unexpected files, fetched over HTTPS only)
* `scan_executable_files` — Uploads-directory observations: PHP/executable files, .htaccess overrides, and symlinks (reported, never followed)
* `audit_admin_accounts` — Privileged-account facts: administrators with recency, admin capabilities outside the role, application-password counts, multisite super admins
* `audit_cron` — Bounded WP-Cron inventory with sub-60-second-schedule and unresolved-callback fact-flags
* `audit_mcp_exposure` — Which other MCP servers are registered on this site, and how many abilities pass the discovery rule such a server applies (abilities are registered site-wide, not per-plugin, so a server resolving targets from that registry picks up mutating ones outside SiteAgent's approval path). The counts describe the abilities, not what any server currently serves. Reports only; changes nothing
* `audit_agent_code` — Executable code an AI agent authored or can author on this site: Angie code snippets (recorded, agent-authored, live per environment), the SiteAgent Power Pack's execute-php / file-write / wp-cli flags, and third-party exec stores. Counts and presence only; never file contents, never a verdict. Reports only; changes nothing
* `audit_rules` — Whether a signed operator ruleset is present and how old it is, 24h block/warn counts, expired-but-listed rules, and the enforcement points in this build. Reports only; changes nothing
* `get_seo_meta` — Read a post/page's SEO title, description, and focus keyword from the active SEO plugin (Rank Math, Yoast, or SEOPress)
* `list_page_blocks` — Read a page's Gutenberg block structure (block names, attributes, nesting)
* `snapshot_get` — Retrieve a stored snapshot of page content (reversible write metadata)

Write tools (approval-gated):

* `elementor_replay_ability` — Executes an approved held Elementor write (destructive, requires Aura approval): claims the hold, re-judges it against the current ruleset, and runs the original Elementor mutation as the user who asked
* `update_plugin_safely` — Backup, update, health-check, auto-rollback on failure
* `clear_caches` — Flush object/opcode caches and detected page-cache plugins
* `cleanup_transients` — Remove expired transients to reduce autoload bloat
* `cleanup_orphaned_assets` — Find and remove unused media (dry-run by default)
* `backup_plugins` — Zip-snapshot one or all active plugins as a rollback safety net
* `set_seo_meta` — Write a post/page's SEO title / description / focus keyword on the active SEO plugin (Rank Math, Yoast, or SEOPress) — on-site, so it works even when a WAF blocks the plugin's own REST endpoint
* `update_page_block` — Update a Gutenberg block's content or attributes (snapshot-first, reversible)
* `create_page_from_blocks` — Create a new page from a Gutenberg block spec (draft-first)

Tools are classified by verb so the Aura Fleet gateway applies the right risk and approval policy automatically.

= Pro: the SiteAgent Power Pack =

Everything above is free and ships in this plugin. Agencies that need an agent to *fix* a site — not just report on it — can add the **SiteAgent Power Pack**, a separate companion plugin that registers higher-capability tools through this plugin's own tool registry.

It is **not** included in this download and is **not** distributed on WordPress.org — the tools it adds execute code, so they don't belong in a hosted repository. It comes with the Aura **Agency** and **Studio** plans, or as **SiteAgent Pro**.

What it adds:

* `read_file` — read a text file from inside wp-content (jailed; refuses wp-config.php).
* `db_query` — a single read-only SQL statement (SELECT / SHOW / EXPLAIN), row-capped.
* `write_file` — write a file inside wp-content, snapshot-first so it can be rolled back.
* `run_wp_cli` — run an allowlisted WP-CLI command, with no shell and no metacharacters.
* `execute_php` — run a PHP snippet against the full WordPress API.

These are governed harder than anything in the free set, deliberately:

1. **Off until you arm them.** The write and code tools do nothing until the site owner sets an explicit constant in `wp-config.php` for each one. Installing the Power Pack alone enables no writes and no code execution.
2. **Human approval, cryptographically enforced.** Once the site holds Aura's approval key (provisioned when you connect the site), each of these calls requires a single-use, signed grant bound to that exact tool and its exact parameters — one only the Aura dashboard can mint, after a human approves the action. A leaked Site Token cannot run them. (Until a site has that key, the gate is dormant — so connect the site from Aura before arming anything.)
3. **Reversible where it can be.** File writes are snapshotted first, so there's a previous state to restore.

The safety model is governance, not a sandbox: `execute_php` is powerful by design. The controls are the constant you set, the human who approves the call, and the audit trail — not a promise that arbitrary code is safe.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an Aura account? =

Yes, you need an Aura account to connect your WordPress sites. Aura offers a free tier that includes up to 3 WordPress sites. [Sign up at my-aura.app](https://my-aura.app).

= Is this plugin safe to use? =

Yes. The plugin uses defence-in-depth: WordPress Application Passwords (the same standard mechanism used by the block editor), a per-site token stored only as a SHA-256 hash and verified timing-safely, per-IP brute-force throttling, an HMAC-signed onboarding handshake, and an optional IP/domain allowlist. No data is transmitted unless a request is made by your Aura instance.

= How do I enable the approval gate for write actions? =

SiteAgent can require a per-action, cryptographically signed approval before it runs a state-changing **MCP tool** (cleanups, cache flushes, SEO writes, safe plugin updates run through the tool interface). Once enabled, each such write must carry a single-use signature that only the Aura dashboard can mint, after a human approves the action — so a leaked Site Token cannot run those tools on its own.

This gate turns on automatically once the site holds Aura's approval key, which is provisioned securely during connection. **If you installed or updated the plugin but have not reconnected the site since, the gate is dormant** and the site runs in the standard token-only mode. To activate it, simply **reconnect the site from your Aura dashboard** — no reinstall is needed.

Note: the approval gate currently covers the MCP tool path. Core, plugin, and theme updates performed over the plugin's direct REST update endpoints are still authorized by the Site Token alone (the standard site-management model), so treat the Site Token as a sensitive credential regardless. Grant coverage for those update endpoints is on the roadmap.

= Does it slow down my site? =

No. The plugin registers only REST API endpoints. It does not load any code, scripts, or database queries on frontend page loads. Your visitors experience zero impact.

= What WordPress versions are supported? =

WordPress 6.2 or higher is required. This is needed for full Application Password support. The plugin has been tested up to WordPress 7.1.

= What PHP versions are supported? =

PHP 7.4 or higher. PHP 8.0+ is recommended.

= Can I restrict which IP addresses can access the API? =

Yes. The plugin supports an optional IP whitelist. If configured, only requests from the specified IP addresses will be accepted. Cloudflare and reverse proxy headers (`CF-Connecting-IP`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`) are fully supported for IP detection.

= Does this work with WordPress multisite? =

The plugin is designed for single WordPress installations. Multisite support is not currently available but is on the roadmap.

= Where is the Site Token stored? =

Only a SHA-256 **hash** of the Site Token is stored, in the WordPress option `aura_worker_site_token` — the raw token is never persisted. It is generated on first activation and shown once so you can copy it; the Aura dashboard keeps the only raw copy. Tokens created by older versions are upgraded to a hash automatically on first use.

= Can I regenerate the Site Token? =

Yes. Use **Regenerate Token** on the **Settings → SiteAgent** page. The new token is shown once. Regenerating invalidates the old token and disconnects the site from Aura until you reconnect with the new one.

= How do I disconnect a site from Aura? =

Remove the site from your Aura dashboard, or deactivate or delete the plugin. If you deactivate the plugin, the REST API endpoints are unregistered and Aura can no longer communicate with the site.

Since 2.13.0, disconnecting from the Aura dashboard happens in two phases. The site is marked disconnected immediately and refuses every change from that moment on — reads keep working — and Aura then has it revoke the Application Password it minted, clear the stored ruleset and gateway key, and finally delete the site token. If the site was mid-disconnect when it lost contact, it finishes the job by itself on its next page load.

= Aura disconnected my site but something is left behind — what do I do? =

Open **Settings → SiteAgent**. A disconnected site says so ("Disconnected by Aura at …") and offers **Remove remaining Aura data**, which revokes what is left and clears the disconnect record — but only once everything it names, the site token included, is proven gone. If it tells you it cannot say which user holds an Application Password, revoke it under **Users → Profile → Application Passwords** and try again. Reconnecting the site to Aura also clears the record, after settling what the previous connection still owed.

= Does Aura store my wp-admin credentials? =

No. Aura uses WordPress Application Passwords, not your main admin password. Application Passwords are scoped specifically for REST API access and can be revoked at any time from **Users → Your Profile** in wp-admin.

= Is the plugin open source? =

Yes. SiteAgent is open source under the GPLv2 or later license. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Digitizers/SiteAgent).

== Changelog ==

= 2.17.1 =
* Snapshots: `create_file()` publishes without `link()`. Most managed hosts put `link()` in `disable_functions` for web PHP (Cloudways does), and 2.17.0 refused every new-file create there (`unsupported_filesystem`). Without `link()` the target is now claimed with an exclusive create — it refuses an existing path and returns an inode this call owns — and the bytes are written into that handle; ownership is checked by inode after the write, so nothing that took the path meanwhile is ever overwritten. What this mode gives up is the empty-to-complete jump: a reader in the milliseconds of the write can see the file grow. A short write leaves the entry empty, never truncated content. Restoring a created file that was edited since puts it back the same way instead of leaving it aside under its `.aura-restore-*` name. A publish interrupted mid-write is reconciled by the stage sweep: the record is voided and marked `interrupted`, the file is never deleted by a restore. `create_file()` answers `published: link | write`.
* `audit_agent_code`: `power_pack.create_publish` says how a create lands on this host (`link` or `write`).

= 2.17.0 =
* New read-only tool `audit_agent_code`: executable code an AI agent authored or can author on this site — Angie code snippets (recorded, agent-authored, and which are live in the environment the loader includes, correlated per snippet directory in both environments), the SiteAgent Power Pack's execute-php / file-write / wp-cli flags, and third-party exec stores (EMCP Pro sandbox, Atarim exec abilities). Counts and presence only; never file contents, never a verdict. Bounded (200 directory entries per environment, `coverage.truncated`), `null` for anything unreadable, `{ error }` per subtree.
* Snapshots: `create_file()` creates a NEW file with the engine owning the whole create — staged beside the target under a non-PHP name, recorded, then published with `link()` (atomic, no-clobber) — so no target ever exists without its record and no partial content is ever visible. Restoring the record claims the path with an atomic rename, verifies the claimed file, and removes it only while its bytes still match; a file edited since is put back and refused (`file_changed_since`), never deleted. The Power Pack's `write_file` adopts it in 0.2.4.
* Tool metadata lists an empty parameter map as `{}` rather than `[]` (SA#83).
* Generic SiteAgent mutations (batch entry, generic single update, generic rollback) renew the self-update lease between phases and heartbeat it from inside the upgrader's own sub-phases, so a slow download, unpack or install is never seized as stale, and a lost lease stops the entry rather than racing its successor (SA#80).
* Every Aura-driven mutation of SiteAgent's own files — self-update, generic single update, the batch entry, the guarded rollback — refuses on a multisite network with `aura_self_update_multisite_unsupported`: the update lock is per site while the plugin directory is shared (SA#79). Other plugins are unaffected.
* A rule-blocked call now says to scope the rule out of the site with `sites`, or release it.

= 2.16.2 =
* `/status`'s door fragment carries `observation`, a per-site door-version witness bumped atomically by every door-state mutation (never by a mere poll) and clock-floored so a restored backup can never reissue a value it already served, so Aura can order overlapping polls by the site's own witness instead of request timestamps; `elementor.governor` reports the current value. The observation witness requires InnoDB for wp_options and 64-bit PHP; without them ordering falls back to Aura's own request order for that site (`elementor.governor` reports why via `observation_unsupported`: `engine` or `php32`).
* `/status` also accepts `door_observation_seen` — Aura's own last accepted observation, echoed back — so the site can bump its witness forward, clock-floored, when a restore rewound its own copy behind Aura's. Accepted for ANY non-negative integer the site's own witness could ever report (no magnitude ceiling — the witness only counts up); honoured only within a fixed headroom below the class ceiling, silently ignored (200, no bump, no error) above it.
* `elementor.governor` reports `counters_as_of` beside the four `_30d` rolling counters, which `observation` does not cover; the counters themselves are `int|null`.
* `interrupted` / `running` / `held` are `null`, not `[]`, when their own queue could not be read, and `observation` is withheld entirely whenever any read behind the fragment was unreadable.
* New `door_write_unsupported` reason `reconnect_guard_unavailable`: a governed write refuses outright on a `$wpdb` replacement that cannot disable reconnects, rather than risk a mutation replaying on a session this plugin no longer controls.
* Door writes report a `committed` tri-state (`true` / `false` / unknown) and answer a retryable 503 with `may_have_run: true` whenever a commit cannot be proven — claims, holds, acks, and rotations alike; `replay()` now forwards `claim()`'s own error instead of a generic one.
* Hold references and pending log-row reservations are derived from the request's own identity, so a retry after an ambiguous commit finds and reuses its own prior write instead of risking a duplicate.

= 2.16.1 =
* `/status` door fragment and `audit_mcp_exposure`'s `elementor.governor` carry `binding`, the site's current binding generation, so Aura can label a departed client's door-log entries without inferring the generation from the rows.

= 2.16.0 =
* Elementor MCP door governance: every write through Elementor >= 4.3's official MCP server is held for approval in Aura unless an operator `allow` rule covers it; `block` refuses; every write that runs is snapshotted first on the site and recorded in a per-site door log Aura drains. New tools `elementor_replay_ability`, `snapshot_get`; new routes `/aura/v1/door/reject`, `/aura/v1/door/ack`; `/status` carries `door`; `audit_mcp_exposure` carries `elementor.governor`. Rules gain the `allow` effect and the `design_system` / `page_create` targets.

= 2.15.0 =
* audit_mcp_exposure reports an `elementor` block: Elementor >= 4.3's official MCP module state, every `elementor_mcp_consent` row, every `Elementor MCP…` Application Password across all users (full detail), and the other Application Passwords of edit_posts users as counts. Every list is bounded (50 / 50 / 200) with a truncation flag beside it; no usermeta value over 256 KB is decoded; a scan that fails is reported as `{ error }` in its place, never as an empty list. Read-only.
* aura_worker_app_password_list() accepts an optional byte bound, enforced in the same statement that returns the value.

= 2.14.0 =
* Feature: **a self-update can now undo itself.** Before installing, SiteAgent
  archives its current build — best-effort: a site without ZipArchive or with
  an unwritable backup directory still updates, and the result says
  `backed_up: false` so the caller knows this one had no way back. After
  installing, SiteAgent asks the new build to prove it came up. The proof is
  written by the build itself: a boot beacon recorded the first time the new
  code serves a request, and a fatal beacon recorded by
  a shutdown guard when the new code dies while loading. A build whose own
  records say it broke is rolled back to the archived one, and compiled
  copies are asked out of the opcode cache (best-effort — a host that
  restricts `opcache_invalidate()` may serve the old compiled code until its
  cache revalidates). The result reports exactly what happened (`backed_up`,
  `verified`, `rolled_back`). When neither record appears, the update stands
  and says it was not verified, never guessed.
* Feature: **one SiteAgent mutation at a time.** Every path that can replace
  SiteAgent's own files — the self-update, the generic plugin update, a batch
  entry, the rollback endpoint — runs under a single per-site claim: taken by
  a conditional insert, seizable only after its holder has gone silent for ten
  minutes (a request that dies never releases), and released only by its
  owner. The self-update additionally renews the claim between its phases,
  so a slow step costs the lease nothing once the next phase begins. An
  overlapping request is answered "in progress" and touches nothing.
* Hardening: backups follow a symlink only while its target stays inside the
  plugin folder — a link pointing out of the tree makes the backup report
  itself incomplete instead of copying unrelated files into an archive.
  Restores never delete through a symlink, root or child, and refuse to run at
  all when a link cannot be removed. A package carrying the version already
  running is refused, because its boot records could not be told apart from
  the old build's. Backup filenames carry a per-operation suffix, so two
  backups started in the same second never overwrite each other.

= 2.13.0 =
* Feature: **Aura can now disconnect a site in two phases, and the site
  refuses changes the moment it is told to.** When Aura sends a disconnect,
  SiteAgent records it and every mutation on the site — SiteAgent's own write
  endpoints, MCP write tools, grant-signed calls, and any WordPress REST write
  made with the Application Password or site token of the departing connection
  — is answered `403 aura_site_unbound` until the site is reconnected. Reads
  keep working, `/status` keeps answering, and Aura's own ruleset endpoint
  stays reachable so the disconnect can be finished or retried.
* Feature: **a departing connection's Application Password stops working
  everywhere, not just on the REST API.** WordPress authenticates Application
  Passwords on XML-RPC as well, so a credential the disconnect could not revoke
  is now refused where WordPress decides whether it authenticates at all. Your
  own Application Passwords are untouched, and so is admin login.
* Feature: **the cleanup is proven, not assumed.** SiteAgent revokes the
  Application Password(s) Aura minted, clears the stored ruleset and the
  gateway public key, forgets the connect bookkeeping, and deletes the site
  token LAST — and only when Aura says the disconnect is final. Every step is
  idempotent, runs in one fixed order, and continues past a step that failed.
  An interrupted disconnect finishes itself on the site's next page load
  (throttled, at most once every five minutes), so a site Aura can no longer
  reach still converges.
* Feature: the answer to a disconnect now names what is still owed:
  `leftovers` lists the credentials or stores this site could not prove it had
  released (`app_passwords`, `options`, `ruleset`, `grant_pubkey`), alongside
  `cleanup_complete`. An empty list means only the shared site token was still
  outstanding; a non-empty one means Aura must keep waiting.
* Feature: **the settings screen tells you when Aura disconnected the site**
  ("Disconnected by Aura at …") and offers **Remove remaining Aura data** — an
  admin-initiated teardown that runs the same proven cleanup, and only clears
  the disconnect record once everything it names, the site token included, is
  gone.
* Feature: manually connected sites (those with no gateway public key, which
  therefore cannot verify a signed document) can be disconnected with a bare
  `{ "unbind": true, … }` body on `POST /wp-json/aura/v2/rules`, authenticated
  by the site token alone. A site that DOES hold a gateway key refuses the
  bare form and requires the signed envelope.
* Safety: every ruleset push now runs under the site-wide claim the connect
  flow already used, so a push, a disconnect and a reconnect can no longer
  interleave. A site already busy answers `503 aura_site_busy`, which is
  retryable. A claim left behind by a killed request is taken over after two
  minutes rather than blocking the site indefinitely.
* Safety: reconnecting (magic link) and **Regenerate Token** now settle the
  previous connection's outstanding cleanup BEFORE installing a new token, and
  release the disconnect record only after the replacement connection is
  installed and read back — so a reconnect that fails halfway leaves the site
  still refusing the departed connection instead of quietly reviving it.
* Fix: a disconnect record damaged in the database is now REPAIRED — rebuilt
  from the site's own state, under the claim — and then torn down through the
  ordinary path. Previously a damaged record was a permanent dead end: the
  site refused every change and no control could clear it.
* Diagnostics: `/status` reports `unbound: { at, site_ref }` while a
  disconnect is outstanding, and `app_password_probe_unproven:
  { count, at, owner }` when the site cannot prove an Application Password was
  revoked — the usual reason a disconnect never finishes. Both are bounded and
  contain no secrets.
* New error codes: `aura_site_unbound` (403 — the site is disconnected),
  `aura_site_busy` (503 — retry), `aura_unbind_incomplete` (409 — something is
  still owed; the answer lists it), `aura_unbind_unreadable` (409 — the
  disconnect record could not be read, which is NOT the same as an incomplete
  cleanup), `aura_unbind_unrepairable` (409), `aura_unbind_marker_stuck`
  (500 — everything was removed but the record itself would not delete),
  `aura_unbind_marker_malformed` (500), `aura_unbind_store_failed` (500) and
  `aura_ruleset_client_mismatch` (409 — a disconnect addressed to a different
  Aura client), which the bare unkeyed form now checks too.
* Compatibility: a 2.13 site that is never sent a disconnect behaves exactly
  as 2.12 did. Nothing on the site changes until Aura asks for one.

= 2.12.0 =
* Feature: **a rule can now apply to some of a client's sites instead of all
  of them.** Aura's signed ruleset names the site each document was issued
  for, SiteAgent stores that identity, and a rule that lists the sites it
  applies to is enforced only where it belongs. Rules that name no sites are
  client-wide exactly as before.
* Safety: a site that cannot prove its own identity — an older record, a
  document issued before this field existed — enforces EVERY rule rather than
  skipping the ones it cannot place. Scoping only ever narrows on proof.
* Upgrade: the identity is recovered offline from the ruleset already stored,
  by re-verifying its signature locally. No new network traffic, and a site
  whose ruleset has not changed since the upgrade is repaired on its next
  request rather than waiting for the next push.

= 2.11.0 =
* Feature: **the magic-link connect now mints an Application Password for
  the dashboard.** A magic-link connection could run SiteAgent's own tools
  but not the builder tools (Elementor MCP and friends) that authenticate
  with WordPress Basic auth — only a manual connect, which never provisions
  the gateway key, could. The signed /connect callback now also mints an
  Application Password named "Aura SiteAgent" for the administrator who
  created the link and returns it once, in the callback's response, so the
  dashboard stores it encrypted beside the site token. Every connect rotates
  it (earlier ones under that name are deleted first). Where Application
  Passwords are unavailable (no HTTPS, disabled by a filter, no admin user)
  the connect succeeds token-only as before and names the reason.
* The whole install — token, client binding, gateway key, Application
  Password — runs under one site-wide connect claim, so two callbacks for the
  same site cannot split the credentials the dashboard ends up holding.
  "Regenerate Token" takes the same claim (it is refused while a connect is
  installing). The claim is never taken over by age: a callback the dashboard
  timed out on may still be running. Every write the install makes — the site
  token, the client binding, the dashboard URL, the gateway key — is issued by
  a statement conditional on holding the claim, so a claim that goes away
  mid-request costs that request its connect (retryable) rather than letting it
  overwrite the install that replaced it. If a
  killed request ever leaves a claim behind, every later connect is refused
  until an administrator deactivates and reactivates the plugin, which
  releases it.
  "Regenerate Token" issues its cleanup the same way, and skips revoking the
  Application Password when it no longer owns the claim — the password on the
  site then belongs to whichever connect replaced it. It still reveals the
  token it stored: refusing to would revoke the old token while showing no
  replacement.
* Deactivating the plugin now also revokes the Application Password Aura
  minted. Unregistering SiteAgent's routes does not stop an
  administrator-level credential from authenticating to WordPress core and to
  other REST/MCP plugins, so "deactivated" would not have meant
  "disconnected". If the revocation fails the owner and UUID are kept, and
  reactivating finishes the job (activation retries a revocation deactivation
  could not land), as does uninstalling. The site token binding survives
  deactivation, so the settings screen keeps showing the dashboard it is
  connected to. The Connect button is always reachable there, and the line above
  it says what the site actually holds: a working credential, one that was never
  delivered, none at all, or a site that cannot issue one (token-only).

= 2.10.3 =
* Fix (security): **"Regenerate Token" revealed a new site token without ever
  storing it.** The option was registered as a read-only setting, and the
  callback enforcing that ran on every write — not only on the settings form —
  so the handler's write was discarded while the one-time reveal still
  appeared. Two consequences: an admin rotating a leaked token was told it was
  revoked when the old token stayed valid, and a site disconnected from the
  dashboard could not be reconnected, because no token the screen displayed
  ever authenticated. The token is no longer registered as a setting (it is
  display-only, so nothing submits it), and regeneration now stores the new
  hash with a single compare-and-swap, out of reach of any option filter — a
  token is revealed only when that one statement reports it wrote the row, and
  a site whose row is missing or empty can be given its first token the same
  way.

= 2.10.2 =
* Fix: a site moved from one Aura client to another while the old client's
  last push was still in flight could end up holding the old client's ruleset
  and refuse the new client's rules until it was reconnected. The connect
  callback now names the client the site belongs to (a signed, optional field
  — older dashboards keep working unchanged) and writes that binding into the
  ruleset store itself, so a ruleset for any other client is refused from then
  on, whatever was in flight.

= 2.10.1 =
* Fix: `audit_rules` could report zero blocked/warned events for the current
  hour. Reading the counters before the hour's first refusal put the bucket in
  WordPress's negative option cache, and the refusal's atomic insert did not
  clear it — so the count stayed at zero for the rest of the request, and on a
  site with a persistent object cache until the cache was flushed. Enforcement
  was never affected; only what the audit reported.
* Fix: two rulesets pushed to a site at the same moment, before it held any,
  could answer the loser with 500 instead of the ordinary "a newer ruleset is
  already installed" decision. Aura retries a 500, so no policy was lost; the
  site now classifies the database's duplicate-key or deadlock answer as the
  lost race it is.

= 2.10.0 =
* New: operator rules, enforced on the site. A rule is an Aura memory entry
  (`rule/<slug>`) naming a resource — the whole site, a page or post by ID, or a
  plugin by slug — with an effect of `block` or `warn` and an optional expiry.
  Aura signs the client's whole ruleset with the same key that signs approval
  grants and pushes it to every connected site (`POST /aura/v2/rules`), the site
  verifies it and keeps only a newer one (a replayed older ruleset is refused
  even when validly signed). No ruleset means no policy — nothing is refused. A
  site that has never been reconnected since signed approvals shipped holds no
  gateway key and cannot verify a ruleset; it says so, and Aura tells you to
  reconnect it.
* Enforcement runs on every path a write can take: inside the tool executor
  before anything runs or is snapshotted; explicitly on the legacy REST update
  routes; and at WordPress core's own REST API for posts and pages — so a rule on
  a page holds against Aura's content tools, an assistant with an application
  password, or another plugin's MCP server alike. A `block` refuses the call and
  names the rule; **a rule outranks an approval** — a granted call is still
  refused, and the message says to release the rule first. A `warn` runs and
  attaches the warning. Previews are never blocked; they now report what a call
  touches and which rule would decide it.
* New: `audit_rules` (read-only) — ruleset presence and age, whether the site
  can verify one, 24h block/warn counts, expired-but-listed rules, and the
  enforcement points in this build.
* Every mutating tool now declares what a call touches; one that does not is
  caught by every rule rather than by none.

= 2.10.1 =
Fixes audit_rules under-reporting the current hour's block/warn counts on
sites with a persistent object cache, and a spurious 500 when two first
rulesets race. No change to enforcement. Recommended.

= 2.10.0 =
Operator rules: write "do not touch checkout" once in Aura and every connected
site refuses the matching change — even an approved one — until the rule is
released. No ruleset, no change in behaviour. Recommended for every site.

= 2.9.1 =
Security hardening: tools that change your site can no longer be run through
another plugin's MCP server without an approval grant. Recommended for every
site, and especially any running a second AI assistant alongside SiteAgent. No
action required; the Aura connection and read-only tools are unaffected.

= 2.9.0 =
Adds five read-only audit tools, including one that reports which other MCP
servers are registered on the site and how many of your abilities are
discoverable to one — worth running if anything else here exposes an AI
assistant. Nothing existing changes behaviour; no action required.

= 2.8.2 =
Security hardening: snapshot restores now reject tampered payloads instead of
unserializing arbitrary objects. Recommended for all users. No action required.

= 2.8.1 =
Documentation only — the listing now describes the optional Power Pack companion
plugin and its governance model. No code changes; no action required.

= 2.8.0 =
Internal snapshot-engine primitives (groundwork for reversible Elementor and
bulk-post editing, not yet exposed over the API) and a clearer SEO-meta
write-failure error. No action required; existing connections keep working.

= 2.3.0 =
Token-only connection: the Aura Site Token alone now authorizes site management. Existing connections keep working — no action required.

= 2.2.4 =
Fixes one-click "Connect to Aura": the magic-link onboarding now targets the Aura app host (`app.my-aura.app`) instead of the marketing domain, so connect works out of the box. Sites that set the `AURA_DASHBOARD_URL` constant are unaffected.

= 2.2.3 =
Accuracy fixes for the auditor tools: `set_seo_meta` refreshes Yoast's cache, `perf_check` counts all WP 6.6+ autoload values, `scan_broken_links` reports true totals, `scan_seo` scores missing excerpts, and `scan_a11y` checks page language. No content changes.

= 2.2.2 =
Adds on-site SEO-meta tools (`get_seo_meta` / `set_seo_meta`) for Rank Math, Yoast, and SEOPress — read and update a page's SEO title, description, and focus keyword, even where a WAF blocks the SEO plugin's REST endpoint. Writes are approval-gated through Aura.

= 2.2.1 =
Adds two read-only auditor tools — `perf_check` and `scan_broken_links` — for performance and link triage across your fleet. No changes to your site; `scan_broken_links` performs no outbound HTTP.

= 2.2.0 =
Adds two read-only auditor tools — `scan_seo` and `scan_a11y` — for SEO and accessibility checks across your fleet. No changes to your site; run on demand through Aura.

= 2.1.0 =
Adds five new MCP agent tools (database info, security scan, user list, cache flush, transient cleanup). Read tools run on demand; cache/transient tools are mutating and gated by Aura's approval policy.

= 2.0.2 =
Fixes the plugin page screenshot caption rendering on WordPress.org. No code changes.

= 2.0.1 =
Documentation update — corrected feature list, security description, endpoint reference, and admin menu location. No code changes.

= 2.0.0 =
Major update: plugin rollback/backup, site health checks, magic-link admin access, and MCP tools. Tested with WordPress 7.0. Recommended for all users.

= 1.3.5 =
Enhanced security with timing-safe comparison and IP whitelisting. Recommended for all users.
