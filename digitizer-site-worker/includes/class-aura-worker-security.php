	 * 403 aura_site_unbound while reads keep working, and it stays refused
	 * until the site is reconnected. That has to hold against a caller holding

	 * Phase B deletes the token LAST, so there is a window in which the token
	 * still authenticates and the site must still refuse.
	 *
	 * Called by every mutating permission callback AFTER validate_request()
	 * has succeeded, never before it: a caller who cannot prove it holds the
	 * token gets the token layer's answer and learns nothing about whether
	 * this site is bound.
	 *
	 * Uses is_set(), not is_set_strict(), deliberately. is_set() answers TRUE
	 * when the marker cannot be READ, and at a refusal boundary that is the
	 * only defensible answer: an unreadable marker is not a clean site, and a
	 * database blip must not re-open every write on a site that was
	 * disconnected. is_set_strict() exists for callers that need to tell a
	 * failed read from a clean one; here the two lead to the same refusal, so
