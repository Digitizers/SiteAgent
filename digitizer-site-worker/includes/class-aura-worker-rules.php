 * call touch something a live rule protects?
 *

 * as a whole:
 *   - matching   (pure; no WordPress)  — match(), is_expired()
 *   - the store  (option-backed)       — accept(), current(), …

	 * Two ID-aware filters, because core fires the post-type-specific name: a
	 * page save is rest_pre_insert_page, a post save rest_pre_insert_post.
	 * Deletion has NO rest_pre_delete_* filter — core's post controller offers
	 * only `rest_{type}_trashable` (a bool) and the after-the-fact
	 * `rest_delete_{type}` action. The seams that can actually refuse are
	 * core's own data-layer short-circuits, which every deletion path goes
	 * through: wp_delete_post() → `pre_delete_post`, wp_trash_post() →
	 * `pre_trash_post`. They fire for wp-admin and WP-CLI too, so the callback
	 * applies the same agent test — a human deleting a page in wp-admin is
	 * unaffected.
	 *
	 * And any mutation on any route, for the freeze: products, media, menus,
	 * settings, routes nobody has thought of. Site rules only — this seam does
	 * not know target IDs; the filters above do.
	 *
	 * A warn at a core seam cannot change core's body; it goes out as a
	 * header. The frame that collects those warnings opens and closes on the
	 * ONE pair of hooks core runs together: both live in respond_to_request()
	 * (class-wp-rest-server.php :1256 and :1318) with no return between them,
	 * and respond_to_request() is reached from dispatch(), so an internal
	 * rest_do_request() opens and closes its own frame too. Neither
	 * rest_post_dispatch (serve_request() only — an internal dispatch never
	 * reaches it) nor rest_pre_dispatch (three exits after it that never reach
	 * a callback) can promise that. Priority 1 for the open, so the frame
	 * precedes guard_core_any()'s records at priority 5.

	/**
	 * Delete option rows by name prefix — and evict what was deleted.
	 *
	 * `$wpdb` finds the names — nothing else can, without the caller knowing
	 * which rules or which hours exist, which is the coupling these sweeps
	 * are built to avoid. But the DELETE goes through `delete_option()`, one
	 * name at a time, and NOT through a second `LIKE` statement.
	 *
	 * Two reasons, and both are about the object cache rather than SQL:
	 *
	 *  1. A raw DELETE removes rows and leaves their `options` cache entries.
	 *     A stale entry for a deleted row is worse than the row itself:
	 *     `add_option()` consults the cache, sees a claim that no longer
	 *     exists, returns false, and the expiry announcement it was supposed
	 *     to permit never fires. `clear()` would report having forgotten every
	 *     claim while the site still behaved as though it remembered them.
	 *  2. A second `LIKE` statement does not delete the set that was read. A
	 *     row inserted between the SELECT and the DELETE is deleted by
	 *     name-pattern while the eviction loop, which only knows the names it
	 *     read, leaves its cached value behind. Deleting exactly the captured
	 *     names cannot do that: whatever is not in the set is left whole, row
	 *     and cache together.
	 *
	 * `$before` is REQUIRED, and that is what closes the last race rather
	 * than narrowing it. Every sweep deletes only names strictly below a
	 * bound — an earlier day, an earlier hour — and nothing in the system
	 * ever creates a name below its own bound: a claim is always for TODAY, a
	 * bucket always for THIS hour. So a name this sweep read can never be
	 * recreated in time to be deleted by a second sweep that did not read it.
	 * An unbounded sweep would have exactly that hole, which is why there is
	 * no longer one anywhere in the class.
	 *
	 * `delete_option()` also handles `notoptions` and the autoload cache the
	 * way core expects, which hand-rolled eviction gets wrong quietly.
	 *
	 * The counts are small by construction — one claim per expired rule per
	 * day, one bucket per hour — so N statements is not a cost worth a
	 * correctness hole.
	 *
	 * `$parse` moves the bound from the NAME to the stored VALUE, for the one
	 * family of rows whose age is not in its name: the magic-link claims, named
	 * after the magic id and dated inside the value. Same closed race — a claim
	 * is always written with the current time, so no row this sweep reads can be
	 * recreated below the bound it read it against.
	 *
	 * @param string        $prefix Option-name prefix.
	 * @param string|int    $before Delete only rows strictly below this — a name
	 *                              when $parse is null, else a parsed value.

	 * mutation. WordPress core's REST API — /wp/v2/*, /wc/v3/*, anything a

	 * through any of those seams, so without this a site that refuses
	 * `aura/v2/snapshot` still accepts `POST /wp/v2/posts` from the
	 * Application Password Aura just unbound.
	 *
	 * IDENTITY COMES FROM THE MARKER, NEVER FROM A LIVE OPTION. By the time
	 * this matters, Phase B has already deleted `aura_worker_connect_user_id`
	 * and the managed Application Password record; the credentials outlive
	 * them, because the site token is deleted LAST. The marker is the only
	 * record of which credentials the departed binding held, which is exactly
	 * why Phase A copies them into it before Phase B removes anything (Task 3).
	 * Any version of this predicate that consults a live option answers
	 * "not the departed binding" for every request that arrives after the
	 * cleanup it exists to survive.
	 *
	 * Three answers, and the reasoning for each:
	 *
	 * 1. The marker cannot be READ — a database failure, or a marker that
	 *    exists and is malformed (Aura_Worker_Unbind::read() answers WP_Error
	 *    for both). TRUE. This is a refusal boundary and an unreadable marker
	 *    is not a clean site; more precisely, it is not evidence that THIS
	 *    request is innocent, and absence of proof of guilt is not proof of
	 *    innocence — the mistake this project has made six times. The cost is
	 *    stated rather than hidden: while a marker is unreadable, EVERY agent
	 *    write through core REST is refused, including credentials that have
	 *    nothing to do with Aura. That site is already refusing every SiteAgent
	 *    mutation for the same reason (refuse_if_unbound() uses is_set(), which
	 *    reads an unreadable marker as set), it is already disconnected, and
	 *    Task 9's removal panel is the operator's way out. A human at the
	 *    keyboard is unaffected either way: every caller of this predicate sits
	 *    behind is_agent_rest_request(), which stands aside for a cookie
	 *    session.
	 * 2. No marker at all. FALSE — the site is bound; nothing here applies.
	 * 3. A marker. TRUE when this request presents one of the credentials the
	 *    marker names:
	 *    - the Application Password whose UUID the marker recorded. The UUID
	 *      alone, never paired with the owner the marker also stored: a UUID
	 *      identifies exactly one password, while `app_password_users` holds
	 *      null for an owner the site could not determine, and requiring a
	 *      match against an unknown would read that unknown as innocence.
	 *    - the token run-as path (Aura_Worker_Security::ran_as_token()), on its
	 *      own. The PATH, not the user id it resolved to: comparing against the
	 *      marker's `connect_user_id` would be strictly WEAKER and wrong,
	 *      because once Phase B has deleted `aura_worker_connect_user_id`,
	 *      resolve_connect_user() falls back to the FIRST administrator — so
	 *      the ids routinely differ on exactly the requests this predicate
	 *      exists to catch.
	 *
	 *      THE TOKEN HASH USED TO NARROW THIS CLAUSE, AND #434 TASK 7 REMOVED
	 *      IT — deliberately, which is what the tripwire in UnbindCoreRestTest
	 *      exists to force. Round-1 MAJOR-1 added the comparison because
	 *      nothing in the plugin cleared the marker on a rebind: a re-connected
	 *      site stayed marked forever, so its NEW binding's token-only requests
	 *      had to be told apart from the departed one's by hash. Task 7 removes
	 *      the premise instead — the connect callback and "Regenerate Token"
	 *      now clear the marker as the last step of a rebind that succeeded end
	 *      to end — and with the premise gone the comparison inverts from a
	 *      narrowing into a HOLE. What "marker present, token differs" means
	 *      today is a rebind that installed the replacement token and then
	 *      failed (the binding write, the gateway key, the mint, the connect
	 *      user), which the two-call bracket deliberately leaves refusing. A
	 *      hash comparison here would wave exactly that half-installed token
	 *      through core REST — re-opening, by another route, the very hole the
	 *      bracket's ordering closes.
	 *
	 *      It also puts this boundary back in step with the other one:
	 *      Aura_Worker_Security::refuse_if_unbound() gates SiteAgent's own
	 *      routes on is_set() alone and has always refused the half-installed
	 *      token. Two seams that must agree about one question now answer it
	 *      the same way.
	 *
	 *      Nothing here reads the site token any more, so its unreadability is
	 *      no longer a case to reason about — a marked site refuses the run-as
	 *      whatever the token says.
