/**
 * MCP Tool: audit_mcp_exposure
 *
 * Read-only inventory of the site's *other* agent doors.
 *
 * WordPress's Abilities API is a site-wide registry: `wp_register_ability()`
 * publishes to the site, not to a server. Any MCP server installed alongside
 * SiteAgent can therefore enumerate that registry and serve whatever it finds,
 * over a transport the Aura gateway never sees — no approval queue, no audit,
 * no fleet visibility. Elementor's Angie 1.1.12 ships exactly such a server at
 * `/mcp/angie`, and its `execute-ability` proxy runs any third-party ability by
 * name.
 *
 * An operator cannot learn this from anywhere else: the other server registers
 * its own routes and reads the shared registry silently. This tool reports what
 * is there so the fleet rollup can flag the sites that have a second door and
 * how much is behind it.
 *
 * Facts, not verdicts — the same contract as the other audit tools. "A second
 * MCP server exists" and "N mutating abilities are exposed by the type rule"
 * are checkable statements. "This site is compromised" is not, and a plugin's
 * abilities being reachable may be exactly what its author intended.
 *
 * @package Aura_Worker

Both `path`s are the class file relative to ABSPATH — the basename alone when it lies outside it — so no absolute server path leaves the audit, in a `path` or in an { error }.

	/**
	 * How many registered abilities PASS the discovery rule co-installed servers
	 * apply, and how many of those mutate.
	 *
	 * This is a property of the abilities, not a claim that anything serves
	 * them. Reachability additionally needs a server that resolves targets from
	 * the site-wide registry — Angie's `execute-ability` does; a server with an
	 * explicit tool list reaches only what it lists, and a site with no second
	 * server at all reaches none of them. The counts are still worth reporting
	 * on such a site, because they say what WOULD be handed over the moment one
	 * is installed, and `servers` is right there to say whether one is. Naming
	 * them after the rule rather than after an outcome keeps a consumer from
	 * reading "40 exposed" as "40 reachable".
	 *
	 * The rule applied is the one co-installed servers use: an ability is
	 * exposed when it declares no `meta.mcp.type`, or declares `tool`. That is
	 * Angie's `Mcp_Adapter_Ability_Discovery` rule, read from its source, and it
	 * gates execution there as well as listing. An ability declaring anything
	 * else — as elementor-mcp 1.30.0+ does for its writes — is not served.
	 *
	 * Mutation is read from the ability's own `readonly` annotation. An ability
	 * that does not classify itself is counted as neither: guessing from a name
	 * would turn a naming convention into a security finding.
	 *
	 * @param bool $abilities_active Whether the registry is available.
	 * @return array
