/**
 * Which transport did this call arrive on?
 *
 * SiteAgent's approval grants are enforced in its own REST handlers. That was
 * sufficient while `aura/*` was the only way to reach a tool. Dual-registering
 * the tools as WordPress abilities (2.5.0) changed the premise: an ability is
 * published to the SITE, not to a server, so any co-installed MCP server that
 * enumerates `wp_get_abilities()` can serve it. Elementor's Angie does exactly
 * that for every third-party ability which does not declare a non-`tool`
 * `meta.mcp.type`.
 *
 * The trust model recorded in class-aura-worker-mcp.php — "the Abilities /
 * Application-Password path has a different, capability-based trust model" —
 * was a deliberate decision, and it is the decision this class revisits. It
 * held while the capability was the whole gate. It stops holding once an AI
 * assistant with an admin application password can reach a mutating tool
 * through somebody else's MCP server, because then "capability-gated" means
 * "an agent may mutate the site with no approval, no snapshot binding, and no
 * audit entry" — the invariant the product exists to keep.
 *
 * Modelled on the fork's `Elementor_MCP_Call_Context` (elementor-mcp #59). The
 * shape is deliberately the same so the two can be reasoned about together;
 * the grant verifier and the tool registry are SiteAgent's own.
