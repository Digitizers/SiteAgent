	 * A REBIND mints a new binding generation. Nothing is deleted (Ruling

	 *
	 * This replaces the wipe, and six review rounds of races with it. Deleting
	 * a departed client's queue meant racing every request that might already
	 * be holding, claiming or replaying one of those rows — a lock, a lease, an
	 * in-flight check, each fixing the last one's edge. None of it was
	 * necessary: a hold is only ever readable by the client that queued it, and
	 * that is a question every reader can ask for itself.
	 *
	 * So the generation moves and the rows stay. From here, a row stamped with
	 * the old generation is another client's: `listing()` omits it,
	 * `get_held()` and `claim()` answer as if it were absent, `count()` does
	 * not charge the cap for it, and the reconciler's sweep removes it in its
	 * own time. The LOG is untouched and still served — it is the SITE's audit
	 * trail, and each entry carries the binding that wrote it, so a reader can
	 * see a departed client's entries for what they are and the new binding
	 * drains them by acking.
	 *
	 * The log EPOCH rotates with it, through the same `rotate_epoch()` Aura
	 * uses on a rewind: the new binding starts at cursor 0 rather than
	 * inheriting one it never agreed to.
	 *
	 * VERIFIED and IDEMPOTENT (Ruling P59): the swap is a compare-and-swap
	 * that must change exactly one row, and it is a no-op when the record
	 * already names this identity — so a caller can answer a failure honestly
	 * and the next connect simply does it again.
	 *
	 * A REBIND IS AN UNBIND FOLLOWED BY A CONNECT (Ruling P75). There is no
	 * repoint: a connect meeting a live foreign binding refuses
	 * (`aura_site_bound`) and writes nothing, so the two callers of this are
	 * the unbind's step (4a) — which rotates to `unbound`, retiring the
	 * departed queue and cursor under a state everything can read — and the
	 * connect that follows, which binds a site that is `unbound` or `unset`.
	 * The two are never one request, which is why nothing here has to be safe
	 * against a client change happening under a live binding.
	 *
	 * CLAIM-CONDITIONED, ALWAYS (Ruling P78): a rotation happens under the site
	 * claim its caller holds, or it does not happen. A stale connect handler
	 * that lost the site to a takeover rotated the WINNER's generation from
	 * here, stranding the winner's holds and leaving the record naming a client
	 * that had already been replaced.

	 * ABSENT on a site with no door AND no persisted door state: Aura keys on

	 * so a site that never had Elementor must not report a door — open or
	 * closed. A site whose door state OUTLIVES Elementor still reports (see
	 * present()), with `active: false` — that is how Aura tells "Elementor is
	 * gone, so the door is closed and its seam unchecked" from a broken seam.
	 *
	 * `$after` is Aura's cursor and `$epoch` the epoch that cursor belongs to.
	 * A cursor from ANOTHER epoch says nothing about this log, so it is
	 * ignored and the log is served from the beginning — the same answer
	 * which is also what an absent `door_epoch` gets.
	 *
	 * A cursor from THIS epoch that is above every row AND above the ack
	 * floor is impossible: the log was rewound (a restore, a `wp_options`
	 * roll-back) under the same epoch. It is REPORTED — `rewind.detected`
	 * with the `top` Aura should have been at — and the cursor is ignored so
	 * the rows are served from 0. It is NOT acted on here.
	 *
	 * THIS ENDPOINT NEVER MUTATES (Ruling P20). It used to rotate the epoch
	 * itself, which handed anyone holding the site token a way to invalidate
	 * every ack Aura was about to send: read the epoch, ask for an oversized
	 * `door_after` between Aura's poll and its `/door/ack`, and the ack then
	 * names an epoch the site has moved past and is ignored — repeat, and the
	 * unacked rows climb to MAX_UNACKED and close the write door, with no
	 * grant anywhere. Rotation is Aura's decision, taken on `rewind.detected`
	 * through the grant-gated `POST /aura/v1/door/rotate`.
	 *
	 * `observation` IS READ HERE, NEVER ALLOCATED (Ruling S6, Codex round-3
	 * P1 on #88; see `Aura_Worker_Door_Log::bump_door_version()`'s docblock
	 * for who allocates it — every door-state MUTATION does, not this read).
	 * Issuing the witness up front (Ruling A65) — or even last, once the rest
	 * of the fragment was already built (Ruling S3) — still let two
	 * overlapping requests interleave AROUND a state read that takes more
	 * than one statement: request A finishes reading state and pauses right
	 * before taking its own witness; a door mutation lands and request B
	 * builds and serves the NEW state under a HIGHER version; A resumes,
	 * reads a version below B's, and serves an OLDER snapshot Aura's
	 * strictly-greater comparison would still treat as unordered relative to
	 * B's, or worse, as never having been superseded.
	 *
	 * So this method reads the version, builds the fragment, and reads the
	 * version again. Equal ⇒ nothing mutated between the two reads, so the
	 * fragment truly describes that version (two polls with no mutation
	 * between them legitimately report the SAME observation — identical
	 * state, which Aura's strictly-greater CAS correctly treats as "not
	 * newer"). Different ⇒ a mutation landed mid-build — a TORN READ — and
	 * the fragment is rebuilt once, from a fresh pair of reads. Still
	 * different a second time ⇒ this site's door is mutating faster than one
	 * request can read it consistently, and `observation: null` is the
	 * honest answer — unordered this poll, exactly like every other field

	 * on #88 extends this to attempt 0 too, not only a retry — see
	 * `version_bracketed()`'s own docblock for the reconciler race that
	 * closes). Both callers reach this through `version_bracketed()`'s
	 * shared `$reset_memos` parameter.
	 *
	 * THE BUG THIS CLOSES: `Aura_Worker_Door_Holds::held_rows()` memoises
	 * its read "for the request", and is dropped by `forget_held()` —
	 * called by every held WRITE, so a reader AFTER a write in the SAME
	 * process never sees the queue as it was before it. But a write from a
	 * DIFFERENT request calls `forget_held()` on THAT process's own static,
	 * never on this one's. When a hold mutation lands after this request's
	 * FIRST attempt has already called `listing()` — which is exactly the
	 * window between `status_fragment()`'s two bracketing version reads —
	 * the version mismatch triggers a retry, but the retry's own build call
	 * reused the FIRST attempt's memo unchanged: its own bracketing reads
	 * could both land on the NEW version (nothing mutates a second time),
	 * so the loop returned a fragment reporting the new version with `held`
	 * still missing the hold that caused it. The bracketing reads only
	 * prove state didn't change WHILE this build ran — not that the build
	 * itself read anything fresh; this is what makes the second attempt
	 * capable of actually doing that.
	 *
	 * `self::$active` is included defensively: it is a request-local
	 * memo the builder reads (`active()`, and `door_state()` through it),
	 * and though nothing a hold or log mutation does can change whether
	 * Elementor's module exists, dropping it costs one cheap re-check and
	 * keeps this method the single place a future builder-read memo gets
	 * added, rather than a per-call-site judgement call about which ones
	 * "probably" cannot go stale.
	 *
	 * DELIBERATELY NOT RESET: `self::$seam`, set once per request by
	 * `verify_coverage()` on `wp_abilities_api_init` — nothing in this
	 * retry re-verifies it, so clearing it here would report `seam:
	 * 'unchecked'` on the second attempt instead of the real answer.
	 * `self::$pinned_ruleset`, read only by the WRITE-side judgement calls
	 * (`govern()`, `judge_collateral()`) — `build_status_fragment_state()`
	 * never reads it, so it is not one of "the builder's" memos at all.
	 *
	 * SCOPED TO IN-OBJECT MEMOS ONLY (Ruling S31, Codex round-14 P1 on
	 * #88). `Aura_Worker_Door_Holds::$held_rows`/`$held_read` and
	 * `self::$active` are PHP statics with no equivalent in WordPress's own
	 * object cache — nothing else evicts them, so this method is the only
	 * place that can. Everything else the builder reads (log rows, the
	 * floor, the closure marker, the epoch, the persisted computed tuple,
	 * the door version) now reads RAW at the point of use instead —
	 * `Aura_Worker_Door_Log::get_raw()`/`floor_raw()`/`is_closed_raw()`/
	 * `epoch_raw()`/`full_report_raw()`, `persisted_computed_state()`,
	 * `door_version_raw()` — which makes a SECOND reset entry for each of
	 * them both unnecessary and the wrong shape of fix: an evict LIST here
	 * would enumerate cache keys by hand and silently drift the moment a
	 * new raw read is added to the builder without a matching line added
	 * here; a raw read cannot drift, because there is no cached copy for
	 * this method to have forgotten to clear.
	 *
	 * CALLED BEFORE ATTEMPT 0 TOO, AS OF RULING S66 — this reset used to
	 * run only between retries, on the theory that attempt 0 is always
	 * the first read this call takes and has nothing stale to drop yet.
	 * That theory holds for a memo THIS call's own earlier work
	 * populated, but not for one populated by something ELSE that ran
	 * before `version_bracketed()` ever opened its bracket — the `/status`
	 * route's own `reconcile()` call, which runs before
	 * `status_fragment()` and already reads `held_rows()` through its own
	 * sweep. Calling this once more, for an attempt 0 that (overwhelmingly
	 * often) had nothing to drop anyway, costs one cheap re-check; not

	/**
	 * Persist the computed tuple `{ active, seam, door }` as door STATE, not
	 * merely a REPORT of it (Ruling S22, Codex round-9 P2 on #88).
	 *
	 * THE BUG THIS CLOSES: Elementor deactivating, or the coverage seam
	 * changing, does not itself touch `wp_options` — nothing here mutates
	 * the door log or the hold queue — so `status_fragment()`'s bracketing
	 * version reads both answer the SAME (unchanged) observation even
	 * though `active` and `door` in the fragment just flipped. Aura's
	 * strictly-greater observation comparison then REJECTS the fragment
	 * carrying the new, correct values — its observation is not greater
	 * than the one Aura already has — and keeps serving the STALE
	 * active/open state indefinitely, until some UNRELATED door mutation
	 * happens to bump the version for other reasons.
	 *
	 * Computed state is compared against what was last PERSISTED under
	 * `self::COMPUTED` and, on any difference — including "nothing
	 * persisted yet", the first poll a site ever serves — written through
	 * `Aura_Worker_Door_Log::versioned()`, the SAME choke point every other
	 * door mutation goes through, so the transition itself becomes a real,
	 * version-bumping mutation Aura's comparison can see. A STEADY state
	 * (no difference from what is already persisted) writes NOTHING: this
	 * must not bump the version on every single poll, only on an actual
	 * transition — one mutation per transition, none on a steady state.
	 *
	 * Called from `status_fragment()` before its bracketed version reads —
	 * on EVERY attempt, not only a retry, since the bug bites on the very
	 * first attempt with no torn read required.
	 *
	 * NEVER CALLED FROM `governor_block()` (Ruling S27, Codex round-11 P2 on
	 * #88) — see that method's own docblock for why: an AUDIT request has
	 * typically never run `verify_coverage()`, so `self::$seam` there is
	 * the documented request-local `unchecked`, which almost never matches
	 * a prior `/status` poll's persisted `ok` — every audit read would
	 * therefore look like a transition and version one, advancing the
	 * observation on nothing but a READ.
	 *
	 * THE RETURN VALUE MUST BE HEEDED (Ruling S24, Codex round-10 P2 on
	 * #88). When a transition WAS needed but `versioned()` could not commit
	 * it — a bump-write failure, a failed savepoint, an unproven COMMIT —
	 * this method used to return nothing and the caller carried straight
	 * on: `self::active()`/`self::door_state()` already answer the FRESH
	 * (correct, just-computed) values regardless of whether the persist
	 * landed, so the fragment/block built right after still reported the
	 * new `active`/`door` — but paired with whatever `door_version_raw()`
	 * happened to read, which is the OLD, unchanged version (nothing
	 * committed). Aura's strictly-greater comparison then discarded the
	 * correction it had just been handed, forever, since a caller cannot
	 * tell "this observation truly describes this state" from "the version
	 * read raced an uncommitted write and just happens to match". A caller
	 * that gets `false` back MUST report `observation: null` instead of
	 * whatever it reads — honest: the site could not witness this state.
	 *
	 * THE PERSIST IS A FENCED COMPARE-AND-SWAP, NEVER AN UNCONDITIONAL
	 * OVERWRITE (Ruling S26, Codex round-11 P1 on #88). A request that
	 * loaded Elementor before deactivation can compute `active: true` /
	 * `door: open` here and then PAUSE — a slow poll, a stalled process —
	 * while a NEWER request observes the real deactivation, computes
	 * `active: false` / `door: closed`, and persists THAT, bumping the
	 * version to N. If this older request then resumed and wrote its own,
	 * now-STALE tuple with a plain `update_option()`, it would overwrite
	 * the newer, CORRECT tuple with the older, WRONG one — while its own
	 * bump advances the version to N+1, so a caller reading afterwards sees
	 * the stale `active: true` under a HIGHER, more-recent-looking
	 * observation than the honest transition it just clobbered. The write
	 * is fenced instead: `UPDATE … WHERE option_name = %s AND option_value
	 * = %s`, the exact bytes this call read as `$persisted` — or a
	 * conditional INSERT (`insert_unique_write()`'s own shape) when nothing
	 * was persisted yet. A fence that matches ZERO rows means the tuple has
	 * ALREADY moved since this call read it: a newer transition won, this
	 * call's OWN tuple is not (or no longer) the truth, and nothing here
	 * may claim credit for whatever version is now current — it belongs to
	 * the winner, not to this call's own (possibly stale) read of
	 * `active()`/`door_state()`.
	 *
	 * A DETECTED REWIND IS A STATE TRANSITION TOO (Ruling S29, Codex
	 * round-13 P1 on #88), but tracked OUTSIDE this tuple as of Ruling S74
	 * (Codex round-30 P1 on #88): `rewind` is a field of the served
	 * fragment itself, so `sync_served_identities()`'s own hash of the
	 * ACTUAL fragment (never a hand-built subset — see that method's own
	 * docblock for why this ruling exists) already covers a rewind being
	 * detected, resolved, or its `top` changing, with no separate
	 * `rewind_top` tracked here. `detect_rewind()` itself never reads
	 * anything back from THIS tuple as a decision input (it recomputes
	 * fresh from `$after`/`$epoch` on every call), so `rewind_top` was
	 * only ever an OUTPUT this function carried for identity purposes —
	 * exactly what the fragment hash now does instead, from the ACTUAL
	 * served value rather than a copy of it.
	 *
	 * THIS FUNCTION NOW TRACKS ONLY `{ active, seam, door }` (Ruling S74).
	 * Rulings S45/S46/S61/S64/S71/S73 each folded ONE MORE collection's
	 * own identity into this tuple by hand — running/interrupted's
	 * ref-only identity, the log's shape, held's served content, a
	 * canonical snapshot approximating the rest — and every single one of
	 * them, eventually, MISSED a served field a hand-built snapshot never
	 * happened to include (S74's own finding: `epoch`/`binding`, omitted
	 * from Ruling S73's own hand-assembled payload). `sync_served_identities()`
	 * closes the class instead of extending the list again: it runs
	 * AFTER `build_status_fragment_state()` has produced the fragment
	 * this method's own caller is ABOUT TO RETURN, and hashes THAT ACTUAL
	 * ARRAY — so a field this class will grow next year is covered
	 * automatically, not by remembering to add it here. This function's
	 * own job shrinks back to exactly what it cannot be: the
	 * `active`/`seam`/`door` CAS MUST resolve first, because
	 * `build_status_fragment_state()` needs `$computed`'s PERSISTED
	 * values for those three fields (Ruling S28 — a live re-read here
	 * would already be too late to protect against) before it can build
	 * anything the fragment hash could cover.
	 *
	 * @param array|null $rewind          `detect_rewind()`'s own `rewind`
	 *                                      field — UNUSED by this method
	 *                                      as of Ruling S74 (see above);

	 * input.
	 *
	 * THE BUG THIS CLOSES: poll A starts before Elementor deactivates, so
	 * its request-local `active()` memoises `true` for the rest of A's
	 * process. If A's OWN `sync_computed_state()` compares against a
	 * `$persisted` it read BEFORE a faster poll B observes the real
	 * deactivation, persists `inactive/closed`, and bumps the version to
	 * N, A's comparison may already have concluded "steady state" (matching
	 * A's own stale `$current`) and returned WITHOUT ever reaching the CAS
	 * — the fence protects nothing here, because A never attempted a write
	 * to fence. A's bracketing version reads then BOTH land on B's new
	 * version N (nothing further mutates during A's own build), so the old
	 * check — reporting A's LIVE `active: true` / `door: open` paired with
	 * version N — served exactly the state B's own transition just
	 * corrected, under B's own witness. If A's response reached Aura
	 * first, its strictly-greater comparison accepted A's stale state
	 * under N and rejected B's later, EQUAL-version, correct answer as not
	 * newer — permanently.
	 *
	 * Reading the PERSISTED tuple back here — fresh, cache evicted first so
	 * a value this request may have already cached (inside
	 * `sync_computed_state()`'s own read) cannot stand in for what a
	 * DIFFERENT process's write has since superseded — and serving ITS
	 * fields instead closes this: whatever this call reports is provably
	 * the same state the version it pairs with actually describes, because
	 * both are read from the SAME row, and any write racing this read is
	 * caught by `status_fragment()`'s own bracketing version reads
	 * (Ruling S6) exactly as any other torn read is.
	 *
	 * Returns null when nothing has ever been persisted (a fresh site, or
	 * `governor_block()` called before this site's first `/status` poll) —
	 * callers fall back to live computation in that case, since there is
	 * nothing to read back yet.
	 *
	 * PROVEN, never `get_option()` (Ruling S48, Codex round-19 P2 on #88).
	 * `get_option()` answers its own default for EITHER a genuinely absent
	 * row or one it failed to read — indistinguishable, and this method's
	 * callers could not tell "nothing to read back yet" (live computation
	 * is fine, exactly as documented above) from "something IS persisted
	 * here but this read could not prove it" (which must never be served
	 * paired with a witness — the very race this method exists to close,
	 * reopened one layer down). `Aura_Worker_Door_Log::raw_option_for()`
	 * is the SAME proven read `epoch_raw()`/`binding_raw()` use; the
	 * caller reads `Aura_Worker_Door_Log::raw_option_was_unreadable()`
	 * IMMEDIATELY after this method returns to tell the two apart — this

	 * comparison INSIDE this site can ever tell "genuinely unchanged
	 * since the last poll" apart from "rewound to a self-consistent past
	 * state" — both look identical from here.
	 *
	 * No site-local store survives every restore scope (that is
	 * precisely the hole above) — the only witness that does is AURA's
	 * OWN, held entirely outside this site's database. So `/status`
	 * accepts an optional `door_observation_seen`: AURA's own
	 * last-accepted `observation` for the epoch it names in `door_epoch`.
	 * When it EXCEEDS what this site currently holds under that SAME
	 * epoch, this site treats it as a rewind of the WITNESS itself — the
	 * `detect_rewind()` pattern (a cursor from AURA above what this site
	 * can currently prove, under the same epoch, is only ever possible
	 * after a restore) applied to `OBSERVATION` rather than the log's own
	 * top — and forces its own clock-floored restamp
	 * (`Aura_Worker_Door_Log::restamp_observation_forward()`) BEFORE
	 * `status_fragment()`'s own version bracket ever opens, so AURA's
	 * strictly-greater CAS accepts the corrected fragment this poll
	 * serves.
	 *
	 * SAME EPOCH ONLY — mirrors `detect_rewind()`'s own epoch-match gate,
	 * one door down. `$observation_seen` describes a specific door
	 * LIFETIME (the one AURA had epoch `$epoch` on record for); a value
	 * recorded against an epoch this site has since legitimately rotated
	 * PAST describes an instance this site has already left behind, and
	 * comparing it against the CURRENT `OBSERVATION` would force a
	 * spurious bump on the strength of a witness that belongs to a
	 * different door lifetime entirely. An unreadable current epoch read
	 * refuses the SAME way `detect_rewind()`'s own unreadable-epoch case
	 * does — never guessed either way.
	 *
	 * REJECTS SILENTLY, NEVER LOUDLY, when `$observation_seen` is not
	 * strictly greater than what this site can currently prove: this is
	 * the steady-state case (AURA is not ahead of this site, so there is
	 * nothing to repair) on every ordinary poll, and it must cost
	 * nothing — no error, no log line, simply nothing to do. The SAME is
	 * true when `door_version_raw()` itself cannot be proven: acting on

	 * 2. Stale CLAIMS, before stale rows — a claim's own `terminal_seq` is
	 *    better evidence about its row than the row's age is, and settling
	 *    the row first would leave the claim to be settled from an entry it
	 *    no longer explains.
	 * 3. Stale pending ROWS: the requests that never held anything. Each is
	 *    SETTLED before it is recovered (Ruling P45) — the pending-only settle
	 *    is what decides which of two concurrent reconcilers, or which of a
	 *    reconciler and the row's own late-finishing owner, may snapshot or
	 *    compensate the creation it left behind.
	 * 4. The creation mutex, by age alone.
	 * 5. Retention: door envelopes older than 30 days (Ruling R6), and the
	 *    counter buckets past the same window — at most once every

	 * Ruling S87 (Codex round-38 P1 on #88): the ONE entry builder every
	 * `Aura_Worker_Door_Log::open_pending()` call in this class routes
	 * through — see that method's own docblock (Ruling S86) for the
	 * reservation mechanism the `aura_ref` field drives, and this
	 * ruling's own finding for why the mechanism was UNREACHABLE in
	 * production before this: every caller here built its own `$fields`
	 * with no `aura_ref` at all, or (`open_restore_entry()`) had one in
	 * hand and stored it under the wrong key (`ref`, not `aura_ref`).
	 *
	 * PRIORITY, highest first, whenever the caller has not already set
	 * one explicitly:
	 *  1. The REPLAY's own hold ref (`self::$replay_ack['ref']`) — ALREADY
	 *     a globally unique v4 UUID minted once, at hold time
	 *     (`Aura_Worker_Door_Holds::hold()`'s own conditional INSERT), so
	 *     a replay of the SAME queued call always derives the SAME
	 *     reservation, and a retried replay never opens a second pending
	 *     row behind an ambiguous first one.
	 *  2. The presented approval grant
	 *     (`$_SERVER['HTTP_X_AURA_APPROVAL_GRANT']`) — itself a unique,
	 *     call-bound token (`Aura_Worker_Call_Context`'s own memo key:
	 *     the grant AND the exact call it is bound to), for a gated
	 *     operation that presented one.
	 *
	 * ABSENT OTHERWISE — an ordinary, ungated, non-replay write. NO
	 * per-request nonce exists ANYWHERE in this codebase today for that
	 * shape of call: the MCP fleet gateway (a separate repository, Aura's
	 * own) does not currently forward a tool-call id or any other
	 * per-call correlation id to the site for an ordinary ability
	 * invocation, unlike the restore route's own `aura_ref` REST
	 * parameter. Inventing one here (a per-PHP-process nonce, say) would
	 * look like protection while providing none across the one thing
	 * that matters — a NEW HTTP request, which is what an actual retry
	 * is. Left genuinely absent and documented, not silently worked
	 * around: `open_pending()`'s own `reserved_seq` echo-back (Ruling
	 * S86) is what a caller with nothing to derive from still has —
	 * Aura's own retry of an ambiguous write already carries `seq`/`ref`
	 * forward the SAME way for a HELD call (`replay()`'s own `ref`
	 * parameter, class-aura-worker-api.php); the identical shape, once
	 * the gateway is ready to send `reserved_seq` back on retry for a
	 * DIRECT (non-replay) ambiguous write, closes this gap without any
	 * further change on this side.
	 *
	 * @param array  $fields  Whatever the caller already built — ability,
	 *                          actor, touches, and so on.
	 * @param string $purpose Which of this class's OWN distinct
	 *                          open_pending() call sites this is —

	 *                          different log-row purposes never collides
	 *                          (see this method's own docblock for the

	 *    cannot make the entry describe a policy the call was never judged

	 * 3. The call is RE-JUDGED before anything is claimed: a `block`
	 *    delivered while the call sat in the queue refuses it and rejects
	 *    the hold, and a `warn` must be acknowledged by (key, ruleHash) —
	 *    an approver who saw a different rule has not approved this one.

	 *    ACTOR: a user demoted or deleted during the hold's seven days must
	 *    not get a mutation through somebody else's approval.
	 * 5. Only then is the hold claimed, by moving it — and the answer comes

	 *
	 * 1. ELEMENTOR ITSELF (Ruling P30). No `active()`, no ability that can
	 *    execute — so the door is shut whatever else is healthy. This is not
	 *    hypothetical since Ruling P28: a site whose persisted door state
	 *    outlives Elementor goes on reporting, and `verify_coverage()`'s
	 *    inactive branch deliberately leaves the seam `ok` (there is nothing
	 *    uncovered, and closing the transport would 503 a route that does not
	 *    exist — Ruling P6). Without this term the `ok` seam alone reported
	 *    `door: open` on a site where no governed write could possibly run,
	 *    in all three readers at once.
	 * 2. The SEAM: coverage that could not be verified means writes may be
	 *    reaching Elementor ungoverned, so the transport is refused.
	 * 3. The LOG: at MAX_UNACKED every governed write is answered
	 *    `aura_log_full`, which is a closed door by any honest reading — and
	 *    the status fragment went on reporting `open` whenever coverage was
	 *    healthy, contradicting both governor_block() and the ack response on
	 *    the very poll an operator would be looking at to find out why writes
	 *    were failing.
	 *
	 * `seam` is still reported beside this on the fragment and the audit
	 * block, so `active: false` + `seam: ok` + `door: closed` reads exactly as
	 * what it is: nothing is broken, Elementor is simply gone.
	 *
	 * Public because the ack route answers with it too: three readers, one
	 * answer.
	 *
	 * RAW (Ruling S31, Codex round-14 P1 on #88): `is_closed_raw()`, not
	 * `is_closed()` — every caller here (sync_computed_state()'s own
	 * comparison, the fragment builder's live fallback, governor_block()'s)
	 * needs the closure marker as the DATABASE holds it right now, never a
	 * `false`/`true` this request's object cache is still holding from
	 * before a DIFFERENT request closed or reopened the log.
	 *
	 * @return string `open` or `closed`.

	/**
	 * The `elementor.governor` block of `audit_mcp_exposure` (Task 11): what
	 * THIS site's door log and hold queue say, for the fleet rollup — a site
	 * whose log is full, whose hold queue is full, or whose seam never
	 * verified, without polling `/status`.
	 *
	 * `{ active: false }` ALONE when this site carries no door AND never did
	 * (Ruling P6): the caller already gates the whole `elementor` block on
	 * manage_options, and there is nothing else honest to report about a door
	 * that is not there. A site whose door state OUTLIVED Elementor gets the
	 * FULL block with `active: false` instead (Ruling P28) — the holds, the
	 * unacked rows and the counters are all still there to report.
	 * `seam` is reported exactly as `verify_coverage()` last left it —
	 * `unchecked` when that has not run in this request is an honest answer,
	 * not a gap; the audit never forces a coverage check of its own.
	 *
	 * THIS METHOD NEVER WRITES (Ruling S27, Codex round-11 P2 on #88). It
	 * used to call `sync_computed_state()` before reading `observation`
	 * (Ruling S22) — but an AUDIT request has typically never run
	 * `verify_coverage()` at all, so `self::$seam` here is the documented
	 * request-local `unchecked`, which almost never matches whatever a
	 * PRIOR `/status` poll last persisted (commonly `ok`). Every audit call
	 * therefore looked like a real transition and versioned one, advancing
	 * the observation on nothing but a READ — the exact hazard Ruling A65
	 * exists to prevent for every OTHER read in this file
	 * (`door_version_raw()`'s own docblock: never allocated by a read).
	 * `status_fragment()` is the one and only writer of computed state,
	 * because it is the one caller for whom `seam` is always FRESH (this
	 * same request's own coverage check, gated on `active()`, has already
	 * run by the time `/status` calls it — see `verify_coverage()`'s own
	 * call site). This method instead reports the door version exactly as
	 * `Aura_Worker_Door_Log::door_version_raw()` already documents it: the
	 * observation of the last state transition, on-demand, never allocated
	 * by this read.
	 *
	 * `observation` DOES NOT COVER `log_ungoverned_30d` / `unobserved_30d` /
	 * `hook_missed_30d` / `unknown_ability_30d` / `proxy_refused_30d` (Ruling
	 * S49, Codex round-19 P2 on #88; the fifth since 2.19.1). Those counters shrink on their own as their hourly
	 * cutoff advances — no row is mutated when a bucket ages out, so there
	 * is nothing for `sync_computed_state()` to version, and versioning an
	 * hourly-driven shrink would be a FABRICATED mutation rather than a
	 * real one. `counters_as_of` reports the cutoff those fields were
	 * computed against, ISO 8601, so a caller can read the window they
	 * describe without needing (or ever getting) a witness for it — this
	 * block is live evidence for them, not gated by `observation`.

	/**
	 * Release the creation mutex — but ONLY the row this request inserted.

	 * Two conditions, and both are load-bearing. `mutex_held` says this
	 * request took A mutex: one whose insert never landed (it lost the race,
	 * or the statement threw) must not delete anything, because the row it
	 * would delete is another creation's (round 1). And the DELETE is FENCED
	 * on the exact bytes it inserted (Ruling P17), because holding the mutex
	 * once is not the same as holding it now: a creation still running past
	 * CLAIM_STALE_MS has its row cleared by the reconciler
	 * (clear_stale_creation_mutex()) and a second creation takes a
	 * replacement. This request's flag is still set, so an unconditional
	 * delete_option() on its way out would remove the SECOND request's mutex
	 * and let a third creation run beside it. The fence names one row —
	 * seq + started_at — so a replacement, whose seq differs, is never it.
	 *
	 * The same shape as Aura_Worker_Door_Holds::release_lock() and
	 * clear_stale_creation_mutex(): a fenced DELETE, then both option caches
	 * evicted, because the compare is on bytes the cache does not hold.
