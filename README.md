## What is SiteAgent?

SiteAgent is the official remote management agent for the [Aura Infrastructure Hub](https://my-aura.app). It connects your WordPress sites to your Aura dashboard for seamless remote management, monitoring, and updates from a single centralized interface.

---

## Features

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Site Health** | Real-time monitoring of WordPress & PHP versions, plugins, themes, and server health. |
| **One-Click Updates** | Update WordPress core, plugins, and themes remotely from the Aura dashboard. |
| **Safe Update Engine** | Chunked batch updates with health checks and automatic rollback on failure. |
| **Per-Plugin Rollback** | Zip backups in `wp-content/aura-backups/` with one-shot restore. |
| **MCP Tools Layer** | `/aura/mcp/` REST namespace exposing AI-agent-friendly tools with JSON schemas. |
| **Magic Link Onboarding** | One-click connection from wp-admin to the Aura dashboard — HMAC-signed, no token copy/paste. |
| **Maintenance** | Run database upgrades and translation updates across all sites. |
| **Hardened Security** | Hashed site tokens, brute-force throttling, signed magic-link connect, and optional IP/domain allowlists. |
| **Developer API** | Fully exposed via secure REST API endpoints. |

### Zero Frontend Impact

SiteAgent is built for performance. It only registers REST API routes and has **zero impact** on your site's frontend performance — no extra scripts, styles, or queries on page load.

---

## Installation

### Via WordPress.org (Recommended)

1. Go to **Plugins > Add New** in your WordPress admin.
2. Search for **SiteAgent**.
3. Click **Install Now** and then **Activate**.

### Via WP-CLI

```bash
wp plugin install digitizer-site-worker --activate
```

### Manual upload

Download the zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/Digitizers/SiteAgent/releases) and upload via **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.

> The display name is **SiteAgent for Aura**; the WordPress.org slug remains `digitizer-site-worker`.

---

## Security

Layered authentication protects every request:

1. **WordPress Auth:** Application Password with capability checks (`manage_options` / `update_*`).
2. **Site Token:** Per-site token in the `X-Aura-Token` header, **stored as a SHA-256 hash** (never plaintext) and compared timing-safely. Legacy plaintext tokens migrate automatically on first use.
3. **Brute-force throttle:** Per-IP failed-attempt limit returns HTTP 429.
4. **IP / Domain allowlist:** Optional restriction to your Aura instance.

Onboarding via magic link is **HMAC-signed**: the `/connect` callback carries a signature derived from a one-time secret the site issued, plus a timestamp replay window — so the token exchange can't be hijacked or replayed. Rotate the token anytime from **Settings → SiteAgent → Regenerate Token**.

| `GET` | `/context` | Full site context for AI decision-making |

**Built-in MCP tools (21):**

| Tool | Kind | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| `get_site_context` | read | WP/PHP/theme/plugins/disk/performance snapshot + detected issues |
| `get_database_info` | read | DB size, largest tables, autoload weight, expired transients |
| `scan_security` | read | scored posture (file-edit, debug, SSL, default admin/prefix, registration, PHP) |
| `scan_seo` | read | scored SEO posture (indexability, permalinks, sitemap, title) + sampled content audit |
| `scan_a11y` | read | scored accessibility audit (image alt text, link text, headings, document language) |
| `perf_check` | read | scored performance posture (object cache, OPcache, page cache, PHP, autoload, plugins, memory) |
| `scan_broken_links` | read | link triage (empty/anchor, dev/staging hosts, unresolved internal links) — no outbound HTTP |
| `get_seo_meta` | read | a post/page's SEO title, description, focus keyword (Rank Math / Yoast / SEOPress) |
| `list_page_blocks` | read | a page's Gutenberg block structure (names, attributes, nesting) |
| `list_users` | read | users + roles + post counts, admins flagged (never returns secrets) |
| `check_health` | read | live health gate — HTTP, PHP fatals, white-screen, DB |
| `scan_error_log` | read | tail + severity-group the error log, surface recent fatals |
| `check_vulnerabilities` | read | plugins/themes vs the WordPress.org vulnerability DB |
| `set_seo_meta` | write | set a post/page's SEO title / description / focus keyword (approval-gated; only fields you pass change) |
| `update_plugin_safely` | write | backup → update → health check → auto-rollback |
| `clear_caches` | write | flush object/opcode caches + detected page-cache plugins |
| `cleanup_transients` | write | remove expired transients (autoload hygiene) |
| `cleanup_orphaned_assets` | write | find/remove unused media (dry-run by default; live delete approval-gated) |
| `backup_plugins` | write | zip-snapshot one or all active plugins (rollback safety net) |
| `update_page_block` | write | update a Gutenberg block's content/attributes (snapshot-first, reversible) |
| `create_page_from_blocks` | write | create a new page from a Gutenberg block spec (draft-first) |

These plug straight into **Aura's Fleet MCP Gateway**: read tools run on demand, write tools are gated behind human approval, every call is audited. Tool names are classified by verb so the gateway applies the right risk policy automatically.

---

## Changelog

### 2.7.0

- **Approval gate extended to the REST write endpoints (H3).** G-grants previously covered only the MCP `tools/execute` path; the direct REST writes Aura uses for updates (`/v1/update/{core,plugin,theme,translations,database}`, `/v1/self-update`, `/v2/update/batch`, `/v2/rollback/{slug}`) ran as admin off a valid `X-Aura-Token` with no grant check. Each now calls `Aura_Worker_Grant::require_for()` — when a gateway pubkey is provisioned, the write requires a fresh single-use Ed25519 grant bound to the exact action name and parameters (batch binds `chunk_size` + `create_backup` too, so an approved batch can't be replayed with backups off). A leaked Site Token can no longer trigger a code update or rollback. Sites without a provisioned key keep working token-only until they reconnect.
- **Self-update source allowlist.** `self-update` now installs only from the official `Digitizers/SiteAgent` GitHub repo or GitHub's release-asset CDNs, over HTTPS — bounding even an approved self-update to a trusted source. Overridable via the `aura_worker_self_update_allowed_hosts` filter.
- Requires the Aura gateway to mint grants for these endpoints (Aura H3 P2); until that ships, publish only to sites whose gateway attaches update grants.

### 2.6.1

- **Tool self-declaration hardening** (no new tools — set stays at **21**): the six mutating tools (`update_plugin_safely`, `cleanup_orphaned_assets`, `backup_plugins`, `cleanup_transients`, `clear_caches`, `set_seo_meta`) now explicitly declare themselves non-read-only and approval-required instead of inheriting neutral defaults, so any consumer that trusts a tool's own annotations gates them correctly. Live behaviour is unchanged — grant enforcement and the gateway's verb policy already treated them as writes.
- `cleanup_orphaned_assets` now advertises a preview: its dry-run (find orphans, delete nothing) is exposed through the preview API, so the orphaned-media sample can be inspected without approval before the destructive delete.

### 2.6.0

- **Signed approval grants (G-grants):** every mutating MCP tool reached over the Aura gateway (`X-Aura-Token`) path now requires a single-use, Ed25519-signed grant that binds the exact tool, parameters, site, and a short validity window — so a stolen site token can only ever run **read** tools, never a write or a power op. The plugin stores only the gateway's **public** key, so even a fully compromised site can't mint its own grants. The key is provisioned over the HMAC-signed magic-link `/connect` callback, and enforcement activates only once it's present, so existing deployments are unaffected until they reconnect.

### 2.5.0

- **WordPress Abilities API bridge:** SiteAgent tools are dual-registered as WP abilities when the core Abilities API is present, so the official MCP adapter and standard MCP clients can discover them (the `aura/mcp` namespace is unchanged).
- Hardening (external review) across the abilities registration, snapshot engine (fail-closed writes, uncollidable absent-option sentinel), and Gutenberg update path (refuses `inner_html` on a block with nested children).

### 2.4.0

- **Gutenberg (block editor) tools** — `list_page_blocks` (read), `update_page_block` (approval-gated, snapshot-first, reversible), `create_page_from_blocks` (draft-first), bringing the built-in set to **21**. The snapshot engine gains a "post" kind so block edits are reversible. Ends the Elementor-only gap — Gutenberg is core WP.

### 2.3.0

- **Token-only connection** (no new tools — set stays at **18**): a valid Aura Site Token authorizes management on its own. After connecting, the plugin runs requests as the connecting administrator (`current_user_can()` passes without an Application Password). Existing app-password connections are unaffected; deploy order vs. the Aura dashboard does not matter.

### 2.2.4

- **Connect-to-Aura host fix** (no new tools — set stays at **18**): the "Connect to Aura" magic-link onboarding now targets the Aura app host (`app.my-aura.app`) instead of the marketing domain (`my-aura.app`), which has no onboarding API, so one-click connect works out of the box. Sites that set the `AURA_DASHBOARD_URL` constant are unaffected.

### 2.2.3

- **Auditor accuracy fixes** (no new tools — set stays at **18**): `set_seo_meta` now invalidates Yoast's cached indexable so SEO changes show on the frontend immediately; `perf_check` counts all WP 6.6+ autoload values (`yes`/`on`/`auto-on`/`auto`); `scan_broken_links` reports true totals instead of the capped sample count; `scan_seo` scores missing excerpts; `scan_a11y` checks the rendered `<html lang>` rather than the configured locale.

### 2.2.2

- **On-site SEO-meta tools** — two agent tools that read and write a post/page's SEO meta directly via the active SEO plugin's own meta keys (Rank Math, Yoast, SEOPress), bringing the built-in set to **18**. `get_seo_meta` (read) returns title / description / focus keyword; `set_seo_meta` (write, approval-gated) sets any subset. Because they run on-site rather than via the SEO plugin's REST endpoint, they work even where a WAF blocks those endpoints.

### 2.2.1

- **Performance & broken-link auditors** — two more read-only agent tools (`perf_check`, `scan_broken_links`), bringing the built-in set to **16**. `perf_check` scores caching layers, PHP, autoload weight, plugin count, memory, and expired transients. `scan_broken_links` triages links over a content sample **without any outbound HTTP** (empty/anchor links, dev/staging hosts, internal links that don't resolve locally). Both auto-register and run as read tools.

### 2.2.0

- **SEO & accessibility auditors** — two new read-only agent tools (`scan_seo`, `scan_a11y`), bringing the built-in set to **14**. Both are scored, no-AI-cost structural audits over a sampled set of published content (indexability/permalinks/sitemap/title + missing excerpts/featured images/thin content for SEO; image alt text, non-descriptive link text, heading structure, document language for accessibility). Auto-register via the tool loader; governed by Aura's risk policy as read tools.
- Cheap, fleet-friendly: run across every site through Aura's Fleet MCP Gateway to spot SEO/a11y regressions at scale.

### 2.1.0

- **MCP ops toolset expansion** — eight new agent tools (`get_database_info`, `scan_security`, `list_users`, `check_health`, `scan_error_log`, `clear_caches`, `cleanup_transients`, `backup_plugins`), bringing the built-in set to **12**. Each auto-registers via the tool loader and is governed by Aura's risk/approval policy.
- `check_health` + `backup_plugins` reuse the existing health-check and rollback engines — building blocks for health-gated fleet-wide safe updates.
- Read tools run on demand; cache/transient/backup tools are mutating and approval-gated.

### 2.0.0 *(stable — live on WordPress.org)*

- **v2 Update Engine:** health checks, per-plugin rollback, chunked batch updates, auto-rollback on failure.
- **MCP Tools Layer:** `/aura/mcp/` namespace with `tools/list`, `tools/execute`, `context`, plus four built-in tools.
- **Magic Link Onboarding:** one-click, **HMAC-signed** connection from wp-admin to the Aura dashboard.
- **Security hardening:** SHA-256 hashed site token (auto-migrates legacy tokens), per-IP brute-force throttle, Regenerate Token UI, timestamp replay protection on `/connect`.
- **Reliability:** core database upgrade now reports real failures instead of always succeeding.
- **Compliance:** WordPress.org Plugin Check fixes — `WP_Filesystem`, `wp_json_encode()`, `gmdate()`, `wp_delete_file()`. Tested up to WordPress 7.0.

### 1.3.5

- Security: timing-safe token comparison, optional IP whitelisting, Cloudflare/reverse-proxy header support.

### 1.3.4

- **Branding Update:** New official icons and banners for WordPress.org.
- **Improved UX:** Updated documentation and installation guides.

### 1.3.3

- **Official WordPress.org Launch:** Now available in the official plugin repository.

### 1.3.0

- Rebranded from "AuraWorker" to "Digitizer Site Worker for Aura"
- New slug: `digitizer-site-worker`
